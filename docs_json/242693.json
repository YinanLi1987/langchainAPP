The AMF shall not assign a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NB-N1 mode and tracking areas not in NB-N1 mode. The UE, upon receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall delete its old TAI list and store the received TAI list. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was received over non-3GPP access, the AMF shall include a single TAI in the TAI list.\nNOTE\u00a02:\tFor non-3GPP access, the operator can allocate a TAI per N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF is locally configured with a TAI. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF can be configured with its own TAI value, or with the same TAI value as other N3IWFs, TNGFs, TWIFs or W-AGFs.\nNOTE\u00a03:\tWhen assigning the TAI list, the AMF can take into account the eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT 5GS optimization.\nThe AMF may include service area restrictions in the Service area list IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE, upon receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the service area restrictions shall act as described in subclause\u00a05.3.5.\nThe AMF may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the forbidden PLMN list as specified in subclause\u00a05.3.13A. In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list. The AMF of a PLMN shall not include a list of equivalent SNPNs.\nIf the ESI bit of the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is set to \"equivalent SNPNs supported\", the AMF of a SNPN may include a list of equivalent SNPNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the initial registration request is for onboarding services in SNPN, the AMF shall not include a list of equivalent SNPNs in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains an SNPN identity. The UE shall store the list as provided by the network. If the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services and is not the initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN, the UE shall remove from the list any SNPN identity that is already in:\n-\tthe \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" list or the \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" list, if the SNPN is not an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[5]); or\n-\tthe \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" list or the \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" list, if the SNPN is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[5]).\nThe UE shall add to the stored list the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list. The AMF of an SNPN shall not include a list of equivalent PLMNs.\nNOTE\u00a03A:\tIf N1 mode was disabled for an SNPN due to reception of 5GMM cause #27 or #62,\u00a0the UE implementation ensures that it does not register to this SNPN due to being part of the list of \"equivalent SNPNs\" received while registered in another SNPN.\nIf the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, the UE is not registered for disaster roaming services, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the forbidden PLMN list as specified in subclause\u00a05.3.13A, any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s).\nIf the Service area list IE is not included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, any tracking area in the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) in the registration area, or in the registered SNPN, is considered as an allowed tracking area as described in subclause\u00a05.3.5.\nIf the REGISTRATION REQUEST message contains the LADN indication IE, based on the LADN indication IE, UE subscription information, UE location and local configuration about LADN and:\n-\tif the LADN indication IE includes requested LADN DNNs, the UE subscribed DNN list includes the requested LADN DNNs or the wildcard DNN, and the LADN service area of the requested LADN DNN has an intersection with the current registration area, the AMF shall determine the requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE as LADN DNNs for the UE;\n-\tif no requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE and the wildcard DNN is included in the UE subscribed DNN list, the AMF shall determine the LADN DNN(s) configured in the AMF whose LADN service area has an intersection with the current registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE; or\n-\tif no requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE and the wildcard DNN is not included in the UE subscribed DNN list, or if the UE subscribed DNN list does not include any of the DNN's in the LADN indication IE, the AMF shall determine the LADN DNN(s) included in the UE subscribed DNN list whose LADN service area has an intersection with the current registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE.\nIf the LADN indication IE is not included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the AMF shall determine the LADN DNN(s) included in the UE subscribed DNN list whose service area has an intersection with the current registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE, except for the wildcard DNN included in the UE subscribed DNN list.\nIf the UE supports WUS assistance information and the AMF supports and accepts the use of WUS assistance information for the UE, then the AMF shall determine the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE, store it in the 5GMM context of the UE, and if the UE is not performing the initial registration for emergency services, the AMF shall include it in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF may consider the UE paging probability information received in the Requested WUS assistance information IE when determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE.\nNOTE\u00a04:\tBesides the UE paging probability information requested by the UE, the AMF can take local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE into account when determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE.\nIf the UE sets the NR-PSSI bit to \"NR paging subgrouping supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF supports and accepts the use of PEIPS assistance information for the UE, then the AMF shall determine the Paging subgroup ID for the UE, store it in the 5GMM context of the UE, and shall include it in the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message as part of the registration procedure. The AMF may consider the UE paging probability information received in the Requested PEIPS assistance information IE when determining the Paging subgroup ID for the UE.\nNOTE\u00a05:\tBesides the UE paging probability information when provided by the UE, the AMF can also take local configuration, whether the UE is likely to receive IMS voice over PS session calls, UE mobility pattern or previous statistical information for the UE or information provided by the NG-RAN into account when determining the Paging subgroup ID for the UE.\nIf the UE set the UN-PER bit to \"unavailability period supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF supports and accepts the use of unavailability period for the UE, then the AMF shall set the UN-PER bit to \"unavailability period supported\" in the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Furthermore, if the AMF is able to determine a UE out-of-coverage period based on satellite coverage availability information, the AMF shall store the determined unavailability period duration and, optionally, the start of the unavailability period, and provide them to the UE by including the Unavailability configuration IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF may determine the periodic registration update timer value based on a network determined unavailability period duration.\n\n\nThe AMF shall include the LADN information which consists of the determined LADN DNNs for the UE and LADN service area(s) available in the current registration area in the LADN information IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.\nIf the UE has set the LADN-DS bit to \"LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the extended LADN information is available for the UE, the AMF shall include the extended LADN information which consists of the determined LADN DNNs for the UE, the S-NSSAIs associated with the determined LADN DNNs for the UE and in the allowed NSSAI, and LADN service area(s) available in the current registration area in the Extended LADN information IE in the Registration accept type 6 IE container IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.\nIf:\n-\tthe UE does not support LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI;\n-\tthe UE is subscribed to the LADN DNN for a single S-NSSAI only; and\n-\tthe AMF only has the extended LADN information;\nthe AMF may decide to provide the LADN service area for that LADN DNN of the extended LADN information as the LADN information and include the LADN information in the LADN information IE of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.\nNOTE\u00a05A:\tIf the LADN service area is configured per DNN and S-NSSAI, in order to serve the UEs that do not support LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI, it is recommended that the LADN DNN is only served by a single S-NSSAI.\nNOTE\u00a05B:\tIn case of the UE is subscribed to the LADN DNN for multiple S-NSSAIs, the AMF can treat this as no extended LADN information is available.\nIf the UE does not support LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI and the AMF has neither the LADN information nor the extended LADN information, the AMF shall not provide any LADN information to the UE.\nThe UE, upon receiving the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the LADN information, shall store the received LADN information. The UE, upon receiving the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the Extended LADN information, shall store the received extended LADN information. If there exists one or more LADN DNNs which are included in the LADN indication IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and are not included in the LADN information IE and Extended LADN information IE in the Registration accept type 6 IE container IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE considers such LADN DNNs as not available in the current registration area.\nThe 5G-GUTI reallocation shall be part of the initial registration procedure.

If UE supports S1 mode, the UE shall initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and indicate that S1 mode is supported as described in subclause\u00a05.5.1.3.2; or\n-\t\"no additional information\", the UE shall consider itself registered for disaster roaming.\nIf the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) included in the IE into the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present.\nIf the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) included in the IE into the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" and remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present.\nIf the ESI bit of the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is set to \"equivalent SNPNs supported\", and the serving SNPN changes, the AMF shall indicate the NID of the serving SNPN in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE shall determine the SNPN identity of the RSNPN from the NID received in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the MCC and the MNC of the new 5G-GUTI.\nIf the UE supporting the reconnection to the network due to RAN timing synchronization status change receives the RAN timing synchronization IE with the RecReq bit set to \"Reconnection requested\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall operate as specified in subclauses\u00a05.3.1.4, 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.1.\nIf the UE supports discontinuous coverage, the AMF may include the Discontinuous coverage maximum time offset IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.\nIf the UE receives, the Discontinuous coverage maximum time offset IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall replace any previously received maximum time offset value on the same satellite NG-RAN RAT type and PLMN with the latest received timer value.\nIf for discontinuous coverage the AMF includes Unavailability configuration IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and sets the End of unavailability report bit to \u201cUE does not need to report end of unavailability\u201d, the UE is not requied to initiate the registration procedure for mobility registration update when the unavailability period duration has ended.\nIf the UE operating as MBSR receives the MBSRAI field of the Feature authorization indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers of the status of MBSR authorization as specified in clause\u00a05.35A.4 of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[8].\n\n* * * End of Changes * * * *\n",
