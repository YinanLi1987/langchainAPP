Within a PLMN or SNPN, a network slice is identified by an S-NSSAI, which is comprised of a slice/service type (SST) and a slice differentiator (SD). Inclusion of an SD in an S-NSSAI is optional. A set of one or more S-NSSAIs is called the NSSAI. The following S-NSSAIs and NSSAIs are defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[8]:\na)\tconfigured NSSAI;\nb)\trequested NSSAI;\nc)\tallowed NSSAI;\nd)\tsubscribed S-NSSAIs;\ne)\tpending NSSAI;\nf)\talternative S-NSSAIs; and\ng)\tpartially allowed NSSAI.\nThe following NSSAIs are defined in the present document:\na)\trejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN;\nb)\trejected NSSAI for the current registration area;\nc)\trejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA;\nd)\trejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached;\ne)\talternative NSSAI; and\nf)\tpartially rejected NSSAI.\nIn roaming scenarios, rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN, rejected NSSAI for the current registration area, rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, or partially rejected NSSAI includes one or more S-NSSAIs for the current PLMN and also contains a set of mapped S-NSSAI(s). An S-NSSAI included in the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA is an HPLMN S-NSSAI.\nIn case of a PLMN, a serving PLMN may configure a UE with:\na)\tthe configured NSSAI per PLMN;\nb)\tNSSRG information if the UE has indicated that it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature;\nc)\t if the UE has indicated it supports the network slice usage control feature;\nd)\tS-NSSAI time validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information; and\ne)\tS-NSSAI location validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI location validity information.\nIn addition, the HPLMN may configure a UE with a single default configured NSSAI and consider the default configured NSSAI as valid in a PLMN for which the UE has neither a configured NSSAI nor an allowed NSSAI. The support for NSSRG information by the UE and the network, respectively, is optional.\nNOTE\u00a00:\tThe network slice usage control feature is not supported in roaming scenarios.\nNOTE\u00a01:\tThe value(s) used in the default configured NSSAI are expected to be commonly decided by all roaming partners, e.g., values standardized by 3GPP or other bodies.\nIn case of an SNPN, the SNPN may configure a UE which is neither registering nor registered for onboarding services in SNPN with:\na)\ta configured NSSAI applicable to the SNPN;\nb)\tNSSRG information if the UE has indicated that it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature;\nc)\tS-NSSAI time validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information;\nd)\t if the UE has indicated it supports the network slice usage control feature; and\ne)\tS-NSSAI location validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI location validity information.\nIn addition, the credential holder may configure a single default configured NSSAI associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the PLMN subscription and consider the default configured NSSAI as valid in a SNPN for which the UE has neither a configured NSSAI nor an allowed NSSAI. If the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN, the serving SNPN shall not provide a configured NSSAI to the UE. The support for NSSRG information by the UE and the network, respectively, is optional.\nThe allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area are managed per access type independently, i.e. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and is applicable for the registration area. If the UE does not have a valid registration area, the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area is applicable to the tracking area on which it was received. If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the allowed NSSAI, the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area, rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA and rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached are applicable to these PLMNs in this registration area.\nThe allowed NSSAI that is associated with a registration area containing TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, can be used to form the requested NSSAI for any of the equivalent PLMNs when the UE is outside of the registration area where the allowed NSSAI was received.\nWhen the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is to be initiated for one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI or the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is ongoing for one or more S-NSSAIs, these S-NSSAI(s) will be included in the pending NSSAI. When the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is completed for an NSSAI that has been in the pending NSSAI, the S-NSSAI will be moved to the allowed NSSAI or rejected NSSAI depending on the outcome of the procedure. The AMF sends the updated allowed NSSAI to the UE over the same access of the requested S-NSSAI. The AMF sends the updated partially allowed NSSAI to the UE only over the 3GPP access. The AMF sends the updated rejected NSSAI over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access. The pending NSSAI is managed regardless of access type i.e. the pending NSSAI is applicable to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access for the current PLMN even if sent over only one of the accesses. If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the pending NSSAI is applicable to these PLMNs in this registration area.\nThe rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN is applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type. The AMF shall only send a rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN when the registration area consists of TAIs that only belong to the registered PLMN. If the UE receives a rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN, and the registration area also contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, the UE shall treat the received rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN as applicable to the whole registered PLMN.\nThe rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA includes one or more S-NSSAIs that have failed the network slice-specific authentication and authorization or for which the authorization have been revoked, and are applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type.\nThe rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN, and the access type over which the rejected NSSAI was sent. The AMF shall send a rejected NSSAI including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\", when one or more S-NSSAIs are indicated that the maximum number of UEs has been reached. If the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI(s) was started upon reception of the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the UE may remove the S-NSSAI(s) from the rejected NSSAI including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\", if the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI(s) expires. If one or more S-NSSAIs are removed from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the timer T3526 associated with the removed S-NSSAI(s) shall be stopped, if running. The UE shall not stop the timer T3526 if the UE selects an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC.\nIf the UE receives a rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the UE shall treat the received rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached as applicable to these equivalent PLMNs when the UE is in this registration area.\nIf the UE has indicated that the UE supports network slice replacement feature and the AMF determines to provide the mapping information between the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI to the UE, the network shall provide the UE with the alternative NSSAI. The alternative NSSAI is managed per access type independently, i.e. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and is applicable for the registration area.\nIf the UE has indicated that the UE supports the partial network slice feature and includes the S-NSSAI(s) in the requested NSSAI, the AMF determines the S-NSSAI(s) to be included in the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause\u00a04.6.2.11. When the AMF provides both the partially allowed NSSAI and the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE, each S-NSSAI shall be either in the partially allowed NSSAI or in the partially rejected NSSAI but not both. The number of S-NSSAIs included in the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI shall not exceed 7. The number of S-NSSAI stored in the partially allowed NSSAI and the allowed NSSAI shall not exceed 8. The partially allowed NSSAI is only applicable to 3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area. The partially rejected NSSAI is only applicable to 3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area.\nNOTE\u00a02:\tBased on local policies, the UE can remove an S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA when the UE wants to register to the slice identified by this S-NSSAI.\nNOTE\u00a03:\tBased on network local policy, network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure can be initiated by the AMF for an S-NSSAI in rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA when the S-NSSAI is requested by the UE based on its local policy.\nNOTE\u00a04: At least one S-NSSAI in the default configured NSSAI or at least one default S-NSSAI is recommended as not subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization, in order to ensure that at least one PDU session can be established to access service, even when Network Slice-specific Authentication and Authorization fails.\nNOTE\u00a05:\tAt least one S-NSSAI in the default configured NSSAI or at least one default S-NSSAI is recommended as not subject to network slice admission control, in order to ensure that at least one PDU session can be established to access service.\nNOTE\u00a06:\tThe rejected NSSAI can be provided by the network via either Rejected NSSAI IE or the Extended rejected NSSAI IE.\n\n* * * Next Change * * * *\n4.6.2.2\tNSSAI storage\nIf available, the configured NSSAI(s) shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C. For a configured NSSAI, if there is:\na)\tassociated NSSRG information, the NSSRG information shall also be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C;\nb)\tassociated NSAG information, the NSAG information shall be stored in the ME;\nc)\tassociated S-NSSAI time validity information, the S-NSSAI time validity information shall also be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C;\nd)\tassociated S-NSSAI location validity information, the S-NSSAI location validity information shall also be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C; and\ne)\tassociated , the  shall also be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C.\nEach of the configured NSSAI stored in the UE, including the default configured NSSAI, is a set composed of at most 16 S-NSSAIs. Each of the configured NSSAI, except the default configured NSSAI, is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription.\nThe allowed NSSAI(s) should be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C. The partially allowed NSSAI(s) should be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C. For an allowed NSSAI, if there is associated alternative NSSAI, the alternative NSSAI should also be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C.\nEach of the allowed NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 8 S-NSSAIs and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity, an access type and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. Each of the alternative NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 8 pairs of S-NSSAI to be replaced and alternative S-NSSAI, and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity, an access type and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. Each of the partially allowed NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 7 S-NSSAIs and a list of TAs for which S-NSSAI is supported, and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity, 3GPP access type and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. The number of S-NSSAI stored in the partially allowed NSSAI and the allowed NSSAI shall not exceed 8.\nEach of the pending NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 16 S-NSSAIs and is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription.\nEach of the rejected NSSAI is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. The S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area are further associated with one or more tracking areas where the rejected S-NSSAI(s) is not available. The S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached are further associated with the access type over which the rejected NSSAI was received. The S-NSSAI(s) in the partially rejected NSSAI are further associated with 3GPP access.\nThere shall be no duplicated PLMN identities or SNPN identities associated with each of the list of configured NSSAI(s), pending NSSAI(s), rejected NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN or SNPN, rejected NSSAI(s) for the current registration area, rejected NSSAI(s) for the failed or revoked NSSAA, and rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached.\nThe UE stores NSSAIs as follows:\na)\tThe configured NSSAI shall be stored until a new configured NSSAI is received for a given PLMN or SNPN. The network may provide to the UE the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the new configured NSSAI which shall also be stored in the UE. When the UE is provisioned with a new configured NSSAI for a PLMN or SNPN, the UE shall:\n1)\treplace any stored configured NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN with the new configured NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN;\n2)\tdelete any stored mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI and, if available, store the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the new configured NSSAI;\n3)\tdelete any stored allowed NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN and, if available, the stored mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI, if the UE received the new configured NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN and the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration requested bit set to \"registration requested\", in the same CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message but without any new allowed NSSAI for this PLMN or SNPN included;\n4)\tdelete any stored rejected NSSAI and partially rejected NSSAI, and stop any timer T3526 associated with a deleted S-NSSAI in the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached if running;\n4A)\tdelete any stored mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the rejected NSSAI; and\n5)\tdelete any S-NSSAI(s) stored in the pending NSSAI that are not included in the new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN or any mapped S-NSSAI(s), if any, stored in the pending NSSAI that are not included in the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI (if the UE is roaming or is in a non-subscribed SNPN);\n\tIf the UE having a stored configured NSSAI for a PLMN ID, receives an S-NSSAI associated with a PLMN ID from the network during the PDN connection establishment procedure in EPS as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[15] or via ePDG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.302\u00a0[16], the UE may store the received S-NSSAI in the configured NSSAI for the PLMN identified by the PLMN ID associated with the S-NSSAI, if not already included in the configured NSSAI and if the number of S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI is less than\u00a016;\n\tThe UE may continue storing a received configured NSSAI for a PLMN and associated mapped S-NSSAI(s), if available, when the UE registers in another PLMN.\nNOTE\u00a01:\tThe maximum number of configured NSSAIs and associated mapped S-NSSAIs for PLMNs other than the HPLMN that need to be stored in the UE, and how to handle the stored entries, are up to UE implementation.\naa)\tThe NSAG information shall be stored until:\n1)\ta new NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access; or\n2)\ta new configured NSSAI without any associated NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access.\n\tThe UE shall remove any S-NSSAI from the NSAG information which is not part of the configured NSSAI, if any.\nNOTE\u00a01A:\tIf the UE is roaming or the current SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN, the UE uses the S-NSSAI(s) in the configured NSSAI to compare against any S-NSSAI from the NSAG information.\n\tWhen a new NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access, the UE shall replace any stored NSAG information for the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) or the registered SNPN and its equivalent SNPN(s) with the new NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.\n\tWhen a new configured NSSAI without any associated NSAG information for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN is received over 3GPP access, the UE shall delete any stored NSAG information for the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) or the registered SNPN and its equivalent SNPN(s).\n\tThe UE shall be able to store 32 NSAG entries in the NSAG information stored for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.\n\tThe UE shall be able to store TAI lists for up to 4 NSAG entries in the NSAG information stored for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.\n\tThe UE needs not to store the NSAG information when the UE is switched off or when the UE is deregistered from the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.\nNOTE\u00a01B:\tThe UE stores the NSAG information associated with the configured NSSAI for at least the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) or the registered SNPN and its equivalent PLMN(s).\nb)\tThe allowed NSSAI shall be stored and the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI (if available) shall be stored for a given PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) in the registration area or SNPN until:\n1)\ta new allowed NSSAI for the same access type (i.e. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access) is received for a given PLMN or SNPN;\n2)\tthe CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE set to \"registration requested\" is received and contains no other parameters (see subclauses\u00a05.4.4.2 and 5.4.4.3);\n3)\tthe REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is received with the \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator of the 5GS registration result IE set to \"Network slice-specific authentication and authorization is to be performed\", and the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains a pending NSSAI and no new allowed NSSAI as described in subclause\u00a05.5.1.2.4 and subclause\u00a05.5.1.3.4;
