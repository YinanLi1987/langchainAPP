For example, the UE can assume that on the fifth expiry of timer T3501, the PCF will abort the procedure and that the PTI value assigned to the procedure will be released.\nf)\tReceipt of an instruction associated with a UPSI which has a PLMN ID part that is equal to the PLMN ID part of the selected SNPN, the instruction contains a UE policy part with a UE policy part type set to \"URSP\", UE's RSNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN and:\n1)\tthe UE has a stored non-subscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication for the selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription indicating that the UE is not allowed to accept URSP signalled by non-subscribed SNPNs; or\n2)\tthe UE does not have a stored non-subscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication for the selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, and the non-subscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication preconfigured in the selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription indicates that the UE is not allowed to accept URSP signalled by non-subscribed SNPNs;\n\tfor a UE operating in SNPN access operation mode.\n\tThe UE shall set the UE policy delivery service cause to #111 \u201cProtocol error, unspecified\u201d for the instruction in the UE policy section management result IE of the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message.\n",
