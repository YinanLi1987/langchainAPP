The SMF shall not include any mapped EPS bearer contexts associated with a PDU session for LADN and with a PDU session which is a multi-homed IPv6 PDU session. If the UE receives any mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session for LADN or for a multi-homed IPv6 PDU session, the UE may locally delete the mapped EPS bearer context. See coding of the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE in subclause\u00a09.11.4.8. In an MA PDU session, the UE shall have one set of the mapped EPS bearer contexts. The network can provide the set of the mapped EPS bearer contexts of the MA PDU session via either access of the MA PDU session. In an MA PDU session, the UE shall support modification or deletion via an access of a mapped EPS bearer context of the MA PDU session created via the same or the other access.\nUpon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall create the default EPS bearer context and the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) based on the parameters of the mapped EPS bearer contexts or the associations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session, if available. The EPS bearer identity assigned for the QoS flow of the default QoS rule becomes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer in the corresponding PDN connection. If there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access, or if there is no corresponding mapped EPS bearer contexts associated with the EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access:\na)\tthe PDU session is not an MA PDU session established over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the UE shall perform a local release of the PDU session; or\nb)\tthe PDU session is an MA PDU session established over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the UE shall perform a local release of the PDU session over 3GPP access and consider that the MA PDU session is established over non-3GPP access only.\nIf there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow(s) of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access which is not associated with the default QoS rule, or if there is no corresponding mapped EPS bearer contexts associated with the EPS bearer identity assigned to the QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule of a PDU session associated with 3GPP access, unless the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access and over non-3GPP access, the UE shall locally delete the QoS rules and the QoS flow description(s). The UE uses the parameters from each PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported to create corresponding default EPS bearer context and optionally dedicated EPS bearer context(s) as follows:\na)\tthe PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:\n1)\tthe PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is \"Unstructured\";\n2)\tthe PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is \"IPv4\";\n3)\tthe PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is \"IPv6\";\n4)\tthe PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is \"IPv4v6\";\n5)\tthe PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\", and the UE, the network or both of them do not support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode; and\n6)\tthe PDN type shall be set to \"Ethernet\" if the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" and the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode;\nb)\tthe PDU address of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context as follows:\n1)\tthe PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to the PDU address of the PDU session, if the PDU session type is \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\"; and\n2)\tthe PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to zero, if the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";\nc)\tthe DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default EPS bearer context, unless the PDU session is an emergency PDU session;\nd)\tthe APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR received in the parameters of the default EPS bearer context of the mapped EPS bearer contexts shall be mapped to the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR of the default EPS bearer context;\ne)\tfor each PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE, PDU SESSION MODIFICATION PENDING or PDU SESSION INACTIVE PENDING:\n1)\tif the UE is performing an inter-system change from N1 mode to WB-S1 mode, the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE; or\n2)\tif the UE is performing an inter-system change from N1 mode to NB-S1 mode, for the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to the default EPS bearer, the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. Additionally, if the UE is performing an inter-system change from WB-N1 mode to NB-S1 mode, for the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to a dedicated EPS bearer, if any, the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE; and\nf)\tfor any other PDU session the UE shall set the state of the mapped EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.\nAdditionally, for each mapped EPS bearer context or the association between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session:\na)\tthe EPS bearer identity shall be set to the EPS bearer identity received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS bearer identity associated with the QoS flow;\nb)\tthe EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow;\nc)\tthe extended EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped extended EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the extended EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow; and\nd)\tthe traffic flow template shall be set to the mapped traffic flow template of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the stored traffic flow template associated with the QoS flow, if available.\nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall associate the PDU session identity, the S-NSSAI, and the session-AMBR with the default EPS bearer context, and for each EPS bearer context mapped from one or more QoS flows, associate the QoS rule(s) for the QoS flow(s) and the QoS flow description(s) for the QoS flow(s) with the EPS bearer context.\nIf the PDU session is associated with the control plane only indication and supports interworking with EPS, after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall associate the EPS bearer context(s) of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the control plane only indication.\nIf the PDU session is associated with a PDU session pair ID, after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the PDU session pair ID. If the PDU session is associated with an RSN, after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the RSN.\nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if:\na)\tthe UE sent the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator and received the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator in the PDU session; or\nb)\tthe PDU session is associated with the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicators;\nthe UE shall associate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session with the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicators.\nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF shall maintain the PDU session type of the PDU session until the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released if the UE supports non-IP PDN type and the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\".\nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF shall maintain the following 5GSM attributions and capabilities associated with the PDU session until the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released:\na)\tthe always-on PDU session indication;\nb)\tthe maximum number of supported packet filters;\nc)\tthe support of reflective QoS;\nd)\tthe maximum data rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection supported by the UE for uplink and the maximum data rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection supported by the UE for downlink;\ne)\tthe support of multi-homed IPv6 PDU session; and\nf)\tif the PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access, the PDN connection of the default EPS bearer corresponding to the MA PDU session shall be considered as a user-plane resource of the MA PDU session.\nAfter inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE operating in single-registration mode in a network supporting N26 interface shall deem that the following features are supported by the network on the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session:\na)\tPS data off; and\nb)\tLocal address in TFT.\nIf there is a QoS flow used for IMS signalling, after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the EPS bearer associated with the QoS flow for IMS signalling becomes the EPS bearer for IMS signalling.\n\nWhen the UE is provided with a new session-AMBR in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall discard the corresponding association and associate the new valuewith the default EPS bearer context.\nThe network may provide the UE with one or more QoS rules by including either one QoS rules parameter, or one QoS rules with the length of two octets parameter, but not both, in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
