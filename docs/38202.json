More specifically, the physical-layer model captures:\n-\tThe structure of higher-layer data being passed down to or up from the physical layer;\n-\tThe means by which higher layers can configure the physical layer;\n-\tThe different indications (error indications, channel-quality indications, etc.) that are provided by the physical layer to higher layers.\n5.1\tUplink model\n5.1.1\tUplink shared channel\nThe physical-layer model for Uplink Shared Channel transmission is described based on the corresponding PUSCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 5.1.1-1.
