Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x	the first digit:
1	presented to TSG for information;
2	presented to TSG for approval;
3	or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y	the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z	the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
shall		indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
shall not	indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions "shall" and "shall not" are confined to the context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions "must" and "must not" are not used as substitutes for "shall" and "shall not". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced document.
should		indicates a recommendation to do something
should not	indicates a recommendation not to do something
may		indicates permission to do something
need not	indicates permission not to do something
The construction "may not" is ambiguous and is not used in normative elements. The unambiguous constructions "might not" or "shall not" are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
can		indicates that something is possible
cannot		indicates that something is impossible
The constructions "can" and "cannot" are not substitutes for "may" and "need not".
will		indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
will not		indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
might	indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
might not	indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document
In addition:
is	(or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact
is not	(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact
The constructions "is" and "is not" do not indicate requirements.

3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
release independent: applicable to some frozen releases, starting from a certain release Rel-M
NOTE 1:	Normally, a feature is introduced only in the latest open release Rel-N and future releases are based on the previous one so that future releases inherit the requirements of this feature. Introducing a feature "in a release independent way from Rel-M onwards" (M<N) means it was decided by TSG RAN that this feature would be also beneficial in previous, already frozen releases starting with Rel-M until Rel-(N-1). In order to avoid touching TS 38.101 [2-5] or TS 38.133 [6] of these frozen releases, the corresponding requirements are captured in TS 38.307 via pointers to [2-5] or [6] of the release in which the feature was introduced.
NOTE 2:	Release independent does not mean applicable to all releases.
3.2	Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:
N	Release in which a feature is introduced into TS 38.101 [2-5] or TS 38.133 [6]
M	Release from which onwards (including release M) a feature is release independent

3.3	Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
BW	Bandwidth
CA	Carrier Aggregation
CC	Component carrier
DL	Downlink
EN-DC	Dual connectivity between E-UTRA and NR
FDD	Frequency Division Duplex

SUL	Supplementary uplink
TDD	Time Division Duplex 
UE	User Equipment
UL	Uplink

4	General
TSG-RAN has agreed for certain features (see the following clauses) to introduce them in a "release independent way".
This means for each feature:
-	it is "introduced" in a release N, i.e. TS 38.101 [2-5] and TS 38.133 [6] of release N define certain UE requirements for this feature; the feature is indicated in the tables of the following clauses;
-	it is "release independent" starting from a release M (M<N); M for the given feature is provided in the tables of the following clauses;
-	UEs supporting this feature have to fulfil additional requirements in release M or higher which are specified in one or more Annexes of TS 38.307 of release N; the applicable Annexes for a given feature are provided in the tables of the following clauses.
The applicable UE Categories are specified in TS 38.306 [7] according to the release to which the UE conforms.
In the table of release independent features in subsequent clauses, "FDD, TDD" refers to CA or EN-DC configuration composed by only FDD bands or only TDD bands, respectively. "FDD and TDD" refers to CA or EN-DC configuration including both FDD and TDD bands. "SDL and FDD, SDL and TDD" refers to CA configuration including both SDL and FDD bands or both SDL and TDD bands, respectively.  "TDD and SUL" refers to SUL configuration including both TDD and SUL bands. "FDD and TDD and SUL" refers to EN-DC configuration including both FDD, TDD and SUL bands. Unless stated otherwise, the release independent for the band combinations are from Rel-15. Configurations with BCSs other than BCS5 are release independent from Rel-15, where the BCSs for configurations are defined in TS 38.101-1 [2] and/or TS 38.101-3 [4]. Configurations with BCS5 are release independent from Rel-17, and BCS5 with signalling is allowed for early implementation from Rel-15. Note that BCS4/BCS5 is not applicable to intra-band EN-DC configurations.
When a new feature is introduced only the latest release of release independent spec needs to be updated. The latest release of release independent spec refers to the release which the new feature is introduced in. If an RF feature introduced in the same release as the release which the feature is independent from, (i.e. M=N), the common UE RF requirements table in annex B.4 is specified from release N+1, otherwise the common UE RF requirements table is specified from release N.
