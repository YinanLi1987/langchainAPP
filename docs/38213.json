The UE assumes that SSS, PBCH DM-RS, and PBCH data have same EPRE. The UE may assume that the ratio of PSS EPRE to SSS EPRE in a SS/PBCH block is either 0 dB or 3 dB. If the UE has not been provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE may assume that the ratio of PDCCH DMRS EPRE to SSS EPRE is within -8 dB and 8 dB when the UE monitors PDCCHs for a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI, or for a DCI format 2_7, or for a DCI format 4_0.\nFor a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks, the first symbol indexes for candidate SS/PBCH blocks are determined according to the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks as follows, where index 0 corresponds to the first symbol of the first slot in a half-frame. \n-\tCase A - 15 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes of . \n-\tFor operation without shared spectrum channel access:\n-\tFor carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . \n-\tFor carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .\n-\tFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, as described in [15, TS 37.213], .\n-\tCase B - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes . For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, .\n-\tCase C - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes . \n-\tFor operation without shared spectrum channel access\n-\tFor paired spectrum operation\n-\tFor carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, . For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, . \n-\tFor unpaired spectrum operation\n-\tFor carrier frequencies smaller than 1.88 GHz, . For carrier frequencies within FR1 equal to or larger than 1.88 GHz, .\n-\tFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, .\n-\tCase D - 120 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2, .\n-\tCase E - 240 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2-1, .\n-\tCase F \u2013 480 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2-2,  \n-\tCase G \u2013 960 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH blocks have indexes . For carrier frequencies within FR2-2, \nFrom the above cases, if the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks is not provided by ssbSubcarrierSpacing, the applicable cases for a cell depend on a respective frequency band, as provided in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] and [8-2, TS 38.101-2]. A same case applies for all SS/PBCH blocks on the cell. If a 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS is indicated by ssbSubcarrierSpacing, Case B applies for frequency bands with only 15 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and the case specified for 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS in [8-1, TS 38.101-1] applies for frequency bands with 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS or both 15 kHz and 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]. For a UE configured to operate with carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a frequency band of FR2 or with frequency-contiguous carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a frequency band of FR1, if the UE is provided SCS values by ssbSubcarrierSpacing for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on any cells from the set of cells, the UE expects the SCS values to be same. \nThe candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame are indexed in an ascending order in time from 0 to , where  is determined according to SS/PBCH block patterns for Cases A through G.  is a maximum number of SS/PBCH block indexes in a cell, and the maximum number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks within a half frame is .\n-\tFor operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2, and for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, \n-\tFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1,  for  and 15 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks and for  and 30 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks \nFor , a UE determines the 2 LSB bits of a candidate SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described in [4, TS 38.211].\nFor , a UE determines the 3 LSB bits of a candidate SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping with an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described in [4, TS 38.211]\n-\tfor , the UE determines the 1 MSB bit of the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bit  as described in [5, TS 38.212]\n-\tfor , the UE determines the 2 MSB bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits  as described in [5, TS 38.212]\n-\tfor , the UE determines the 3 MSB bits of the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits  as described in [5, TS 38.212]\nA UE can be provided per serving cell by ssb-periodicityServingCell a periodicity of the half frames for reception of the SS/PBCH blocks for the serving cell. If the UE is not configured a periodicity of the half frames for receptions of the SS/PBCH blocks, the UE assumes a periodicity of a half frame. A UE assumes that the periodicity is same for all SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell.\nFor initial cell selection, a UE may assume that half frames with SS/PBCH blocks occur with a periodicity of 2 frames. \nFor operation without shared spectrum channel access, an SS/PBCH block index is same as a candidate SS/PBCH block index.\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that transmission of SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame is within a discovery burst transmission window that starts from the first symbol of the first slot in a half-frame. The UE can be provided per serving cell by discoveryBurstWindowLength a duration of the discovery burst transmission window. If discoveryBurstWindowLength is not provided, the UE assumes that the duration of the discovery burst transmission window is a half frame. For a serving cell, the UE assumes that a periodicity of the discovery burst transmission window is same as a periodicity of half frames for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell. The UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst. If MSB , , of ssb-PositionsInBurst is set to 1, the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to  may be transmitted; if MSB  is set to 0, the UE assumes that the SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. If MSB , , of inOneGroup is set to 1, and MSB , , of groupPresence is set to 1, the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s) within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index determined by  and  may be transmitted; otherwise, the UE assumes that the SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted.\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, a UE assumes that SS/PBCH blocks in a serving cell that are within a same discovery burst transmission window or across discovery burst transmission windows are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'typeA' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214], if a value of  is same among the SS/PBCH blocks.  is an index of a DM-RS sequence transmitted in a PBCH of a corresponding SS/PBCH block, and  is either provided by ssb-PositionQCL or, if ssb-PositionQCL is not provided, obtained from a MIB provided by a SS/PBCH block according to Table 4.1-1 with  [4, TS 38.211]. The UE can determine an SS/PBCH block index according to , or according to  where  is the candidate SS/PBCH block index. The UE assumes that within a discovery burst transmission window, a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks on a serving cell is not larger than  and a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks with a same SS/PBCH block index is not larger than one.\nTable 4.1-1: Mapping between the combination of subCarrierSpacingCommon and LSB of ssb-SubcarrierOffset to  for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1\n\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, a UE assumes that SS/PBCH blocks in a serving cell that are within a same discovery burst transmission window or across discovery burst transmission windows are quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'typeA' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable, if a value of  is same among the SS/PBCH blocks, where  is the candidate SS/PBCH block index.  is either provided by ssb-PositionQCL or, if ssb-PositionQCL is not provided, obtained from a MIB provided by a SS/PBCH block according to Table 4.1-2. The UE can determine an SS/PBCH block index according to . The UE assumes that within a discovery burst transmission window, a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks on a serving cell is not larger than  and a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks with a same SS/PBCH block index is not larger than one.\nTable 4.1-2: Mapping between subCarrierSpacingCommon to  for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2\nFor operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2, a UE expects a MIB in a SS/PBCH block to provide subCarrierSpacingCommon = 'scs30or120'.\nUpon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present if  [4, TS 38.211] for FR1 or if  for FR2. The UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if  for FR1 or if  for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set may be provided by PDCCH-ConfigCommon. \nFor a serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires time and frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell, or on the PSCell, or on an SCell if applicable as described in [10, TS 38.133], of the cell group for the serving cell.\n4.2\tTransmission timing adjustments\nA UE can be provided a value  of a timing advance offset for a serving cell by n-TimingAdvanceOffset for the serving cell. If for a serving cell the UE is provided two coresetPoolIndex values 0 and 1 for first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoolIndex value for first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoolIndex value of 1 for second CORESETs, the UE can be provided first and second  values by n-TimingAdvanceOffset and n-TimingAdvanceOffset2 for transmissions with first and second spatial filters associated with first and second TCI states for the first and second CORESETs, respectively. A UE can be provided a second  value for transmissions with second spatial domain filters corresponding to second TCI states or to second SS/PBCH block receptions associated with physCellId different from physCellId for the serving cell in addition to a first  value for transmissions with first spatial domain filters corresponding to first TCI states or to first SS/PBCH block receptions associated with physCellId for the serving cell. The first and second  values correspond to first and second TAGs indicated in respective MAC RARs [11, TS 38.321] having an association indicated by tag-Id-ptr with first and second joint TCI states provided by dl-OrJointTCI-StateList or first and second UL TCI states provided by ul-TCI-State-List. If the UE is not provided n-TimingAdvanceOffset for a serving cell, the UE determines a default value  of the timing advance offset for the serving cell as described in [10, TS 38.133]. \nIf a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, a same timing advance offset value  applies to both carriers for transmissions on the serving cell that are associated with a same TAG. The UE does not expect to apply two  values for transmissions on the SUL carrier. \nUpon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG, the UE adjusts uplink timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all the serving cells in the TAG based on a value  that the UE expects to be same for all the serving cells in the TAG and based on the received timing advance command where the uplink timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmissions is the same for all the serving cells in the TAG. \nFor a band with synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC in a band combination with non-applicable maximum transmit timing difference requirements as described in Note 1 of Table 7.5.3-1 of [10, TS 38.133], if the UE indicates ul-TimingAlignmentEUTRA-NR as 'required' and uplink transmission timing based on timing adjustment indication for a TAG from MCG and a TAG from SCG are determined to be different by the UE, the UE adjusts the transmission timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all serving cells part of the band with the synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC based on timing adjustment indication for a TAG from a serving cell in MCG in the band. The UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH in one CG when the PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH is overlapping in time, even partially, with random access preamble transmitted in another CG.\nFor a SCS of  kHz, the timing advance command for a TAG indicates the change of the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing for the TAG in multiples of . The start timing of the random access preamble is described in [4, TS 38.211].\nA timing advance command [11, TS 38.321] in case of random access response or in an absolute timing advance command MAC CE or in a cell switch command, , for a TAG indicates  values by index values of  = 0, 1, 2, ..., 3846, where an amount of the time alignment for the TAG with SCS of  kHz is .  is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and is relative to the SCS of the first uplink transmission from the UE after the reception of the random access response or absolute timing advance command MAC CE or the cell switch command.\nIn other cases, a timing advance command [11, TS 38.321], , for a TAG indicates adjustment of a current  value, , to the new  value, , by index values of  = 0, 1, 2,..., 63, where for a SCS of  kHz, . \nIf a UE has multiple active UL BWPs, as described in clause 12, in a same TAG, including UL BWPs in two UL carriers of a serving cell, the timing advance command value is relative to the largest SCS of the multiple active UL BWPs. The applicable  value for an UL BWP with lower SCS may be rounded to align with the timing advance granularity for the UL BWP with the lower SCS while satisfying the timing advance accuracy requirements in [10, TS 38.133]. \nAdjustment of an  value by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission timing for the TAG by a corresponding amount, respectively.\nFor a timing advance command received on uplink slot  and for a transmission other than a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a fallbackRAR UL grant as described in clause 8.2A or 8.3, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to a successRAR as described in clause 8.2A, the corresponding adjustment of the uplink transmission timing applies from the beginning of uplink slot  where ,  is a time duration in msec of  symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured,  is a time duration in msec of  symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 [6, TS 38.214],  is the maximum timing advance value in msec that can be provided by a TA command field of 12 bits,  is the number of slots per subframe,  is the subframe duration of 1 msec, and , where  is provided by cellSpecificKoffset and  is provided by a Differential Koffset MAC CE command [11, TS 38.321]; otherwise, if not respectively provided,  or .  and  are determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG and of all configured DL BWPs for the corresponding downlink carriers. For , the UE assumes  [6, TS 38.214]. Slot  and  are determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG.  is determined with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for all uplink carriers in the TAG and for all configured initial UL BWPs provided by initialUplinkBWP. The uplink slot  is the last slot among uplink slot(s) overlapping with the slot(s) of PDSCH reception assuming , where the PDSCH provides the timing advance command and  is defined in [4, TS 38.211].\nIf a UE changes an active UL BWP between a time of a timing advance command reception and a time of applying a corresponding adjustment for the uplink transmission timing, the UE determines the timing advance command value based on the SCS of the new active UL BWP. If the UE changes an active UL BWP after applying an adjustment for the uplink transmission timing, the UE assumes a same absolute timing advance command value before and after the active UL BWP change.\nIf the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is only partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing advance command as described in [10, TS 38.133], the UE changes  accordingly. If a UE operates with two TAGs on an active UL BWP of a serving cell, the UE expects that a difference between a first downlink timing associated with a first TAG and a second downlink timing associated with a second TAG is not larger than the CP length for the active UL BWP unless the UE indicates larger-thanCP-capability. If a UE indicates XYZ_capability, and transmits SRS based on a configuration by SRS-PosResourceSet in SRS-PosRRC-InactiveConfig-ValidityArea in RRC_INACTIVE state, \n-\tif the UE is provided SRS-autonomousTAupdate, the UE may autonomously update  at cell reselection as described in [10, TS 38.133]\n-\tif the UE is not provided SRS-autonomousTAupdate, the UE maintains the  of a last serving cell prior to the release of a dedicated RRC connection [11, TS 38.321].\nFor operation with single TAG on a serving cell, if two adjacent slots overlap due to a TA command or due to update of  or , when applicable, the latter slot is reduced in duration relative to the former slot. The UE does not change  during an actual time domain window for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission [6, TS 38.214]. If the UE is not provided enableSTx2PofMDCI and operates with two TAGs on a serving cell, the UE does not expect transmissions associated with different TAGs to overlap unless the UE indicates XYZ; if the UE indicates XYZ, the UE reduces in duration a latter transmission using a first TAG to avoid overlapping with a former transmission using a second TAG.\nUsing higher-layer ephemeris parameters for a serving satellite, if provided, a UE pre-compensates\u00a0the two-way transmission delay on the service link based on\u00a0 that the UE determines using the serving satellite position and its own position. To pre-compensate the two-way transmission delay between the uplink time\u00a0synchronization\u00a0reference point and the serving satellite, the UE determines [4, TS 38.211] based on one-way propagation delay  that the UE determines as:\n\nwhere , , and  are respectively provided by ta-Common, ta-CommonDrift, and ta-CommonDriftVariant and  is provided by epochTime which is the epoch time of ta-Common, ta-CommonDrift, and ta-CommonDriftVariant [12, TS 38.331].  provides a distance at time  between the serving satellite and the uplink time synchronization reference point divided by the speed of light. The uplink time synchronization reference point is the point where DL and UL are frame aligned with an offset given by .\n4.3\tTiming for secondary cell activation / deactivation\nWith reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, when a UE receives in a PDSCH an activation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot n, the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133] and no earlier than slot , except for the following:\n-\tthe actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell that is active in slot \n-\tthe actions related to the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell [11, TS 38.321] that the UE applies in slot \n-\tthe actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell which is not active in slot that the UE applies in the earliest slot after  in which the serving cell is active.\nThe value of  is  where slot n+m is a slot indicated for PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.2.3 and  is a number of slots per subframe for the SCS configuration  of the PUCCH transmission as defined in [4, TS 38.211].\nWith reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, if a UE receives a deactivation command [11, TS 38.321] for a secondary cell ending in slot , the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133], except for the actions related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE applies in slot . \nIf the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell expires in slot , the UE applies the corresponding actions in [11, TS 38.321] no later than the minimum requirement defined in [10, TS 38.133], except for the actions related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE applies in the first slot that is after slot  where  is the SCS configuration for PDSCH reception on the secondary cell.\n5\tRadio link monitoring\nThe downlink radio link quality of the primary cell is monitored by a UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, on the primary cell unless the UE indicates a capability rlm-BM-BFD-L3-IntraFreq-CD-SSB-MeasWithoutInterrupt [18, TS 38.306]. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS.\nIf the UE is configured with a SCG, as described in [12, TS 38.331], and the parameter rlf-TimersAndConstants is provided by higher layers and is not set to release, the downlink radio link quality of the PSCell of the SCG is monitored by the UE for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP on the PSCell unless the UE indicates a capability rlm-BM-BFD-L3-IntraFreq-CD-SSB-MeasWithoutInterrupt [18, TS 38.306].\nA UE can be configured for each DL BWP of a SpCell [11, TS 38.321] with a set of resource indexes, through a corresponding set of RadioLinkMonitoringRS, for radio link monitoring by failureDetectionResources. The UE is provided either a CSI-RS resource configuration index, by csi-RS-Index, or a SS/PBCH block index, by ssb-Index. The UE can be configured with up to  RadioLinkMonitoringRS for link recovery procedures, as described in clause 6, and for radio link monitoring. From the  RadioLinkMonitoringRS, up to  RadioLinkMonitoringRS can be used for radio link monitoring depending on  as described in Table 5-1, wherein  is as defined in clause 4.1, and up to two RadioLinkMonitoringRS can be used for link recovery procedures. \nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, when a UE is provided a SS/PBCH block index by ssb-Index, the UE is expected to perform radio link monitoring using SS/PBCH block(s) in the discovery burst transmission window as described in clause 4.1, where the SS/PBCH block(s) have candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index provided by ssb-Index.\nIf the UE is not provided RadioLinkMonitoringRS and the UE is provided for PDCCH receptions TCI states that include one or more of a CSI-RS\n-\tthe UE uses for radio link monitoring the RS provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH reception if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes only one RS\n-\tif the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes two RS, the UE expects that one RS is configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' [6, TS 38.214] and the UE uses the RS configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for radio link monitoring; the UE does not expect both RS to be configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD'\n-\tthe UE is not required to use for radio link monitoring an aperiodic or semi-persistent RS\n-\tFor , the UE selects the  RS provided for active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in CORESETs associated with the search space sets in an order from the shortest monitoring periodicity. If more than one CORESETs are associated with search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in clause 10.1.\nA UE does not expect to use more than  RadioLinkMonitoringRS for radio link monitoring when the UE is not provided RadioLinkMonitoringRS.\nValues of  and  for different values of  are given in Table 5-1. \nTable 5-1:  and  as a function of maximum number  of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame\n\nFor a CSI-RS resource configuration, powerControlOffsetSS is not applicable and a UE expects to be provided only 'noCDM' from cdm-Type, only 'one' and 'three' from density, and only '1 port' from nrofPorts [6, TS 38.214].\nIf a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided by RadioLinkMonitoringRS for the active DL BWP or, if RadioLinkMonitoringRS is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the RS(s) provided for the active TCI state for PDCCH receptions in CORESETs on the active DL BWP. \nIn non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time period defined in [10, TS 38.133] against thresholds (Qout and Qin) configured by rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold. The UE determines the indication period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link monitoring resources and 10 msec.\nIn DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous time period defined in [10, TS 38.133], against thresholds (Qout and Qin) provided by rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold. The UE determines the indication period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for radio link monitoring resources and the DRX period.\nThe physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality is assessed, out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Qout for all resources in the set of resources for radio link monitoring. When the radio link quality is better than the threshold Qin for any resource in the set of resources for radio link monitoring, the physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link quality is assessed, in-sync to higher layers.\n6\tLink recovery procedures\nA UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set  of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList and a set  of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRSList or candidateBeamRSListExt or candidateBeamRSSCellList for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. Instead of the sets  and , for each BWP of a serving cell, the UE can be provided respective two sets  and  of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes by failureDetectionSet1 and failureDetectionSet2 that can be activated by a MAC CE [11 TS 38.321] and corresponding two sets  and  of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by candidateBeamRS-List and candidateBeamRS-List2, respectively, for radio link quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. The set  is associated with the set  and the set  is associated with the set .\nIf the UE is not provided  by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set  to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH. If the UE is not provided  and  for a BWP of the serving cell, the UE determines the set  and  to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by TCI-State for first and second CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH, respectively, where the UE is provided two coresetPoolIndex values 0 and 1 for the first and second CORESETs, or is not provided coresetPoolIndex value for the first CORESETs and is provided coresetPoolIndex value of 1 for the second CORESETs, respectively. If there are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set  or , or  includes RS indexes configured with qcl-Type set to 'typeD' for the corresponding TCI states. If a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI states and the UE is provided sfnSchemePdcch set to 'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the set  includes RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the two TCI states. \nThe UE expects the set  to include up to two RS indexes. If the UE is provided  or , the UE expects the set  or the set  to include up to a number of  RS indexes indicated by maxBFD-RS-resourcesPerSetPerBWP. If the UE is not provided  or , and if a number of active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs is larger than , the UE determines the set  or  to include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values as the RS indexes in the RS sets associated with the active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in the first or second CORESETs corresponding to search space sets according to an ascending order for PDCCH monitoring periodicity. If more than one first or second CORESETs correspond to search space sets with same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines the order of the first or second CORESETs according to a descending order of a CORESET index. \nIf a UE\n-\tis not provided coresetPoolIndex or is provided coresetPoolIndex with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell,\n-\tis provided coresetPoolIndex with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on the active DL BWP of the serving cells, and\n-\tis provided SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI\nSS/PBCH block indexes associated with a physical cell identity other than the one provided by physCellId in ServingCellConfigCommon can be provided in  set and the corresponding  set is associated with the physical cell identity.\nThe UE expects single port RS in the set , or , or . The UE expects single-port or two-port CSI-RS with frequency density equal to 1 or 3 REs per RB in the set , or , or . The thresholds Qout,LR and Qin,LR correspond to the default value of rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold, as described in [10, TS 38.133] for Qout, and to the value provided by rsrp-ThresholdSSB or rsrp-ThresholdBFR, respectively. \nThe physical layer in the UE assesses the radio link quality according to the set , , or , of resource configurations against the threshold Qout,LR. For the set , the UE assesses the radio link quality only according to SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell or the PSCell or periodic CSI-RS resource configurations that are quasi co-located, as described in [6, TS 38.214], with the DM-RS of PDCCH receptions by the UE. The UE applies the Qin,LR threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from a SS/PBCH block. The UE applies the Qin,LR threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power with a value provided by powerControlOffsetSS. \nIn non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE provides an indication to higher layers when the radio link quality for all corresponding resource configurations in the set , or in the set  or , that the UE uses to assess the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Qout,LR. The physical layer informs the higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Qout,LR with a periodicity determined by the maximum between the shortest periodicity among the SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell or the PSCell and/or the periodic CSI-RS configurations in the set , , or  that the UE uses to assess the radio link quality and 2 msec. In DRX mode operation, the physical layer provides an indication to higher layers when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Qout,LR with a periodicity determined as described in [10, TS 38.133].\nFor the PCell or the PSCell, upon request from higher layers, the UE provides to higher layers the periodic CSI-RS configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes from the set , or , or  and the corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that are larger than or equal to the Qin,LR threshold. \nFor the SCell, upon request from higher layers, the UE indicates to higher layers whether there is at least one periodic CSI-RS configuration index or SS/PBCH block index from the set , or , or  with corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that is larger than or equal to the Qin,LR threshold, and provides the periodic CSI-RS configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes from the set , or , or  and the corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that are larger than or equal to the Qin,LR threshold, if any. \nFor the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a link to a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceId, as described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE is provided recoverySearchSpaceId, the UE does not expect to be provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET associated with the search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceId.\nFor the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR, a configuration for PRACH transmission as described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot  and according to antenna port quasi co-location parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated with index  provided by higher layers [11, TS 38.321], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceId for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot , where  is the SCS configuration for the PRACH transmission and  is a number of slots provided by kmac [12, TS 38.331] or  if kmac is not provided, within a window configured by BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring in a search space set provided by recoverySearchSpaceId and for corresponding PDSCH receptions, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index  until the UE receives by higher layers an activation for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.

If ,  contention based preambles with consecutive indexes associated with SS/PBCH block index , , per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index , where  is provided by totalNumberOfRA-Preambles for Type-1 random access procedure.\nFor link recovery, a UE is provided  SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by ssb-perRACH-Occasion in BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For a dedicated RACH configuration provided by RACH-ConfigDedicated, if cfra is provided, a UE is provided  SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by ssb-perRACH-Occasion in occasions. If , one SS/PBCH block index is mapped to  consecutive valid PRACH occasions. If , all consecutive  SS/PBCH block indexes are associated with one PRACH occasion. \nSS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or in ServingCellConfigCommon are mapped to valid PRACH occasions in the following order where the parameters are described in [4, TS 38.211].\n-\tFirst, in increasing order of preamble indexes within a single PRACH occasion\n-\tSecond, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions\n-\tThird, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot\n-\tFourth, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots\nAn association period, starting from frame 0, for mapping SS/PBCH block indexes to PRACH occasions is the smallest integer number in the set determined by the PRACH configuration period according Table 8.1-1 such that  SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once to the PRACH occasions within the association period, where a UE obtains  from the value of ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or in ServingCellConfigCommon. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH block indexes to PRACH occasions mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles that are not mapped to  SS/PBCH block indexes, no SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles. An association pattern period includes one or more association periods and is determined so that a pattern between PRACH occasions and SS/PBCH block indexes repeats at most every 160 msec. PRACH occasions not associated with SS/PBCH block indexes after an integer number of association periods, if any, are not used for PRACH transmissions.\nFor a PRACH transmission by a UE triggered by a PDCCH order, the PRACH mask index field, if the value of the random access preamble index field is not zero, indicates the PRACH occasion for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the SS/PBCH block index indicated by the SS/PBCH block index field of the PDCCH order and, if any, a cell indicator field indicates a cell for the PRACH transmission [5, TS 38.212].

If the PDCCH reception for the PDCCH order includes two PDCCH candidates from two linked search space sets based on searchSpaceLinkingId, as described in clause 10.1, the last symbol of the PDCCH reception is the last symbol of the PDCCH candidate that ends later. The PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10 (except clause 10.4), 11.1, 11.1.1 and 17.2.\nFor a PRACH transmission triggered by higher layers, if ssb-ResourceList is provided, the PRACH mask index is indicated by ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex which indicates the PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the selected SS/PBCH block index.\nThe PRACH occasions are mapped consecutively per corresponding SS/PBCH block index. The indexing of the PRACH occasion indicated by the mask index value is reset per mapping cycle of consecutive PRACH occasions per SS/PBCH block index. The UE selects for a PRACH transmission the PRACH occasion indicated by PRACH mask index value for the indicated SS/PBCH block index in the first available mapping cycle. \nFor the indicated preamble index, the ordering of the PRACH occasions is\n-\tFirst, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions\n-\tSecond, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot\n-\tThird, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots \nFor a PRACH transmission with  preamble repetitions, a set consists of  valid PRACH occasions that are consecutive in time, use same frequency resources, and are associated with same one or more SS/PBCH block index(es), and each SS/PBCH block index is associated with same preamble indexes in all valid PRACH occasions within the set.\nFor a PRACH transmission with preamble repetitions, a time period, starting from frame 0, is the smallest integer number of association pattern periods such that at least one set of valid PRACH occasions for each of the  SS/PBCH block indexes can be determined within the time period for all configured number of preamble repetitions. The set(s) of valid PRACH occasions for each configured number of preamble repetitions repeats every time period.\nWithin a time period, for set(s) of  valid PRACH occasions for a PRACH transmission with  preamble repetitions \n-\tthe first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid PRACH occasion \n-\tthe first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any, is determined according to an ordering of valid PRACH occasions \n-\tfirst, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions\n-\tsecond, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions \nwhere, for each frequency resource index for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions\n-\tthe first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid PRACH occasion \n-\tthe first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any,  \n-\tis after msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup consecutive valid PRACH occasions in time from the first valid PRACH occasion of the previous set, where each PRACH occasion is associated with same SS/PBCH block index(es) and each SS/PBCH block index is associated with same preambles, if msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup is provided \n-\tis after the PRACH occasions for the previous set, if msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup is not provided\nFor a PRACH transmission triggered upon request by higher layers, a value of ra-OccasionList [12, TS 38.331], if csirs-ResourceList is provided, indicates a list of PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the selected CSI-RS index indicated by csi-RS.

For a PUSCH transmission with repetition Type B, this applies to each actual repetition for PUSCH transmission [6, TS 38.214].\n8.1A\tPUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure\nFor a Type-2 random access procedure, a UE transmits a PUSCH, when applicable, after transmitting a PRACH. The UE encodes a transport block provided for the PUSCH transmission using redundancy version number 0. The PUSCH transmission is after the PRACH transmission by at least  symbols where  for  or ,  for  or ,  for ,  for , and  is the SCS configuration for the active UL BWP.\nA UE does not transmit a PUSCH in a PUSCH occasion if the PUSCH occasion associated with a DMRS resource is not mapped to a preamble of valid PRACH occasions or if the associated PRACH preamble is not transmitted as described in clause 7.5 or clause 11.1 or clause 15 or clause 17.2. A UE can transmit a PRACH preamble in a valid PRACH occasion if the PRACH preamble is not mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion.\nA mapping between one or multiple PRACH preambles and a PUSCH occasion associated with a DMRS resource is per PUSCH configuration provided by MsgA-PUSCH-Resource.\nA UE determines time resources and frequency resources for PUSCH occasions in an active UL BWP from msgA-PUSCH-Config or separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config for the active UL BWP. If the active UL BWP is not the initial UL BWP and msgA-PUSCH-Config or separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config is not provided for the active UL BWP, the UE uses the msgA-PUSCH-Config or separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config provided for the initial UL BWP.\nA UE determines a first interlace or first RB for a first PUSCH occasion in an active UL BWP respectively from interlaceIndexFirstPO-MsgA-PUSCH or from frequencyStartMsgA-PUSCH that provides an offset, in number of RBs in the active UL BWP, from a first RB of the active UL BWP. A PUSCH occasion includes a number of interlaces or a number of RBs provided by nrofInterlacesPerMsgA-PO or by nrofPRBs-perMsgA-PO, respectively. Consecutive PUSCH occasions in the frequency domain of an UL BWP are separated by a number of RBs provided by guardBandMsgA-PUSCH. A number of PUSCH occasions in the frequency domain of an UL BWP is provided by nrofMsgA-PO-FDM. \nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the PUSCH occasion is provided by higher layer parameters frequencyStartMsgA-PUSCH and nrofPRBs-perMsgA-PO, the UE expects a PUSCH occasion to be confined within the same RB set as the corresponding PRACH transmission.\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the PUSCH occasion is provided by higher layer parameters interlaceIndexFirstPO-MsgA-PUSCH and nrofInterlacesPerMsgA-PO, the RB set for the PUSCH occasion in the active UL BWP is the same RB set as the corresponding PRACH transmission. The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the UE is not provided intraCellGuardBandsPerSCS for an UL carrier as described in clause 7 of [6, TS 38.214].\nIf a UE does not have dedicated RRC configuration, or has an initial UL BWP as an active UL BWP, or is not provided startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation provides a SLIV and a PUSCH mapping type for a PUSCH transmission by indicating \n-\tone of the first maxNrofUL-Allocations values from PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList, if PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList is provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon\n-\tone of the entries from table 6.1.2.1.1-2 or table 6.1.2.1.1-3 in [6, TS 38.214], if PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList is not provided in PUSCH-ConfigCommon\nelse, the UE is provided a SLIV by startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, and a PUSCH mapping type by mappingTypeMsgA-PUSCH for a PUSCH transmission. \nFor mapping one or multiple preambles of a PRACH slot to a PUSCH occasion associated with a DMRS resource, a UE determines a first slot for a first PUSCH occasion in an active UL BWP from msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainOffset that provides an offset, in number of slots in the active UL BWP, relative to the start of a PUSCH slot including the start of each PRACH slot. The UE does not expect to have a PRACH preamble transmission and a PUSCH transmission with a msgA in a PRACH slot or in a PUSCH slot, or to have overlapping msgA PUSCH occasions for a MsgA PUSCH configuration. The UE expects that a first PUSCH occasion in each slot has a same SLIV for a PUSCH transmission that is provided by startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO or msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation [6, TS 38.214]. \nConsecutive PUSCH occasions within each slot are separated by guardPeriodMsgA-PUSCH symbols and have same duration.

If guardPeriodMsgA-PUSCH is provided, a first symbol of the second hop is separated by guardPeriodMsgA-PUSCH symbols from the end of a last symbol of the first hop; otherwise, there is no time separation of the PUSCH transmission before and after frequency hopping. If a UE is provided with useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon, the UE shall transmit PUSCH without frequency hopping. A PUSCH transmission uses a same spatial filter as an associated PRACH transmission. \nA UE determines whether or not to apply transform precoding for a PUSCH transmission as described in [6, TS 38.214].\nA PUSCH occasion for PUSCH transmission is defined by a frequency resource and a time resource, and is associated with a DMRS resource.

Additionally, for unpaired spectrum and for SS/PBCH blocks with indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or by ServingCellConfigCommon \n-\tif a UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion\n-\tdoes not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and \n-\tstarts at least  symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where  is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if channelAccessMode = \"semiStatic\" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does not transmit [15, TS 37.213].\n-\tif a UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion\n-\tis within UL symbols, or \n-\tdoes not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and \n-\tstarts at least  symbols after a last downlink symbol and at least  symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where  is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if channelAccessMode = \"semiStatic\" is provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does not transmit [15, TS 37.213].\n8.2\tRandom access response - Type-1 random access procedure\nIn response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a window controlled by higher layers [11, TS 38.321] if the PRACH transmission is not triggered by a PDCCH order that includes a Cell Indicator field with non-zero value; otherwise, the UE does not attempt to detect the DCI format 1_0. The window starts at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the last PRACH occasion corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause 10.1. If  or , as defined in [4, TS 38.211], is not zero, the window starts after an additional  msec where  is defined in [4, TS 38.211] and  is provided by kmac or  if kmac is not provided. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by ra-ResponseWindow. \nIf the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE passes the transport block to higher layers. The higher layers parse the transport block for a random access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH transmission. If the higher layers identify the RAPID in RAR message(s) of the transport block, the higher layers indicate an uplink grant to the physical layer. This is referred to as random access response (RAR) UL grant in the physical layer. \nIf the UE does not detect the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1_0, if included and applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher layers, the UE shall be ready to transmit a PRACH no later than  msec after the last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception, where  is a time duration of  symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1 assuming  corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format 1_0, the corresponding PDSCH when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, and the corresponding PRACH. For , the UE assumes  [6, TS 38.214].

A UE transmits PRACH and the PUSCH on a same uplink carrier of a same serving cell. \nA UE transmits a transport block in a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant in a corresponding RAR message using redundancy version number 0, if the PUSCH transmission is without repetitions. If a TC-RNTI is provided by higher layers, the scrambling initialization of the PUSCH corresponding to the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by TC-RNTI. Otherwise, the scrambling initialization of the PUSCH corresponding to the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by C-RNTI. \nIf a UE is provided tag2-Id, the UE transmits a transport block in a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant in a corresponding RAR message with timing advance corresponding to a TAG indicated by the RAR message. \nMsg3 PUSCH retransmissions, if any, of the transport block, are scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message [11, TS 38.321]. \nWith reference to slots for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant, if a UE receives a PDSCH with a RAR message ending in slot  for a corresponding PRACH transmission from the UE, the UE transmits the PUSCH in slot , where  and  are provided in [6, TS 38.214] and  is provided by cellSpecificKoffset; otherwise, if not provided, . \nA UE can be provided in BWP-UplinkCommon a set of numbers of repetitions for a PUSCH transmission with PUSCH repetition Type A that is scheduled by a RAR UL grant or by a DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI.

The UE does not expect to be configured to receive multicast PDSCH on serving cells of the same PUCCH group as serving cells from the sets of serving cells.\nFor unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is provided a PUCCH-sSCell as described in clause 9.A, the UE shall apply the procedures described in this clause for both the primary cell and the PUCCH-sSCell.\nIf a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList-r16, pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is replaced by the relevant entry in pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList-r16.\nIn the remaining of this clause, when a PDCCH reception by a UE includes two PDCCH candidates from corresponding search space sets, as described in clause 10.1\n-\ta PDCCH monitoring occasion is the union of the PDCCH monitoring occasions for the two PDCCH candidates\n-\tthe start of the PDCCH reception is the start of the earlier PDCCH candidate\n-\tthe end of the PDCCH reception is the end of the PDCCH candidate that ends later\nThe PDCCH reception includes the two PDCCH candidates also when the UE is not required to monitor one of the two PDCCH candidates as described in clauses 10 (except clause 10.4), 11.1, 11.1.1 and 17.2.\nIn the remaining of this clause, a last DCI format is from a set of detected DCI formats for which the UE would provide HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in a same slot. Detected DCI formats are first indexed in ascending order across indexes of respective scheduled cells for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, and are then indexed in ascending order across indexes of PDCCH monitoring occasions.

HARQ-ACK information reporting is associated with a CORESET through a reception of a PDCCH with a DCI format triggering the reporting of the HARQ-ACK information by the UE.\nFor NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the UE computes PH assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively.\nIf a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to be configured with a PUCCH-SCell.\nA PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports, including repetitions if any, can be of priority index 0 or of priority index 1. For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a UE determines a priority index from phy-PriorityIndex, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority index from harq-CodebookID, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if provided, in\u00a0a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI\u00a0report.

If a UE indicates a capability to monitor, in an active DL BWP, PDCCH for detection of DCI format that includes a priority indicator field, the DCI format can schedule PUSCH transmissions of any

If the UE is provided a  value by a MAC CE command, the UE applies the MAC CE command in the first slot that is after slot  where  is the slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the MAC CE command,  is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH transmission that is determined in the slot when the MAC CE command is applied. \n9.A\tPUCCH cell switching\nThis clause is applicable when a UE is provided a PUCCH-sSCell by pucch-sSCell and the PUCCH-sSCell is activated and does not have a dormant UL/DL active BWP. This clause is not applicable for slots with  symbols [4, TS 38.211] of a reference SCS configuration provided by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for the PCell where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with  repetitions of any priority, starting from the slot following the slot indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK reporting, or following the slot determined as described in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting, or in clause 5.2.1.4 of [6, TS 38.214] for CSI reporting, until the slot of the last repetition of the PUCCH transmission, as described in clause 9.2.6 if the UE is provided PUCCH-sSCellPattern.\nA UE can be provided a periodic cell switching pattern for PUCCH transmissions by pucch-sSCellPattern. Each bit of the pattern corresponds to a slot with  symbols [4, TS 38.211] for a reference SCS configuration provided by\u00a0tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon\u00a0for the PCell with a value of '0' or a value of '1' indicating, respectively, the PCell or the PUCCH-sSCell as the cell for PUCCH transmissions during the slot with  symbols of the reference SCS configuration. The UE does not transmit a PUCCH in a slot on a cell if the pattern indicates a different cell for PUCCH transmission during the slot. A slot on the active UL BWP of the PUCCH-sSCell does not overlap with more than one slot on the active UL BWP of the PCell. If a slot for the active UL BWP of the PCell overlaps with more than one slot on the active BWP of the PUCCH-sSCell and the UE would transmit a PUCCH on the PUCCH-sSCell, the UE considers the first of the overlapping slots for the PUCCH transmission on the PUCCH-sSCell.\nIf a UE is provided pucch-sSCellDyn or pucch-sSCellDynDCI-1-2 or pucch-sSCellDynDCI-1-3, a corresponding DCI format associated with generation of HARQ-ACK information by the UE can include a PUCCH cell indicator field [5, TS 38.212] with a value of '0' or a value of '1' indicating, respectively, whether a PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information by the UE is on the PCell or on the PUCCH-sSCell. When the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information that is associated only with SPS PDSCH receptions, the UE transmits the PUCCH on the PCell. The UE does not expect the PUCCH cell indicator field to indicate the PUCCH-sSCell for a PUCCH transmission in a slot that overlaps with a slot on the PCell where the UE would transmit another PUCCH of same or different priority index.\nA UE transmits a PUCCH on a PUCCH-sSCell with a power that the UE determines as described in clause 7.2.1, where the UE applies \n-\ta p0-PUCCH-Value from pucch-PowerControl in PUCCH-Config for the PUCCH-sSCell for the determination of \n-\ta pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id from pucch-PowerControl in PUCCH-Config for the PUCCH-sSCell for the determination of \n-\ta PUCCH power control adjustment state  for active UL BWP  of the UL carrier of PUCCH-sSCell  and PUCCH transmission occasion  where  is a TPC command value included in a DCI format associated with generation of HARQ-ACK information for multiplexing in a PUCCH transmission on the PUCCH-sSCell as indicated either by a pucch-sSCellPattern or by a PUCCH cell indicator field in the DCI format, or provided by DCI format 2_2 with CRC scrambled by TPC-PUCCH-RNTI for the PUCCH-sSCell as described in clause 11.3\n9.1\tHARQ-ACK codebook determination\nIf a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList, the UE can be indicated by pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList to generate one or two HARQ-ACK codebooks. If the UE is indicated to generate one HARQ-ACK codebook, the HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 0. If a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList, the UE multiplexes in a same HARQ-ACK codebook only HARQ-ACK information associated with a same priority index. If the UE is indicated to generate two HARQ-ACK codebooks\n-\ta first HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 0 and a second HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 1\n-\tthe UE is provided first and second for each of {PUCCH-Config, UCI-OnPUSCH, PDSCH-codeBlockGroupTransmission} by {PUCCH-ConfigurationList, UCI-OnPUSCH-ListDCI-0-1, PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmissionList} or {PUCCH-ConfigurationList, UCI-OnPUSCH-ListDCI-0-2, PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmissionList}, respectively, for use with the first and second HARQ-ACK codebooks, respectively\nIf a UE receives a PDSCH without receiving a corresponding PDCCH, or if the UE receives a PDCCH indicating a SPS PDSCH release, the UE generates one corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit. If the UE generates two HARQ-ACK codebooks, the UE is indicated by harq-CodebookID, per SPS PDSCH configuration, a HARQ-ACK codebook index for multiplexing the corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit. \nIf a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback and the UE detects a DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1\n-\tthe UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4\n-\tthe UE does not expect that the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field of the DCI format provides an inapplicable value from dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17\nIn the remaining of this clause, reference is to one HARQ-ACK codebook and to DCI formats that schedule PDSCH reception, or have associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception and are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook.\nIf a UE is required to receive SPS PDSCHs in a slot according to Clause 5.1 of [6] and Clause 11.1 for SPS configurations that are indicated to be released by a DCI format, the UE is not expected to receive the DCI format in the slot if the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH reception is after the end of a last symbol of any of the SPS PDSCH receptions. For a SPS configuration subject to pdsch-AggregationFactor or pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16, the UE is not expected to receive the DCI format in a slot containing a SPS PDSCH transmission occasion other than the first transmission occasion required to be received by the UE for a TB.\nIf a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCHs in a slot for SPS configurations that are indicated to be released by a DCI format, and if the UE receives the PDCCH providing the DCI format in the slot, and if HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH release and the SPS PDSCH receptions would be multiplexed in a same PUCCH, the UE does not expect to receive the SPS PDSCHs, does not generate HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH receptions, and generates a HARQ-ACK information bit for the SPS PDSCH release.\nIf a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCH(s) in a slot for SPS configuration(s), the UE does not expect to receive a PDCCH providing a DCI format in the slot to indicate SPS PDSCH release of these SPS configuration(s), if HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH release and the SPS PDSCH reception(s) would map to different PUCCHs.\nIf a UE detects a DCI format 1_1 or a DCI format 1_3 indicating \n-\tSCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception, as described in clause 10.3, and\n-\tis provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic or pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16\nthe UE generates a HARQ-ACK information bit as described in clause 9.1.3 for a DCI format 1_1 or a DCI format 1_3 indicating SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception and the HARQ-ACK information bit value is ACK.\nIf a UE is not provided PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission, the UE generates one HARQ-ACK information bit per transport block. \nFor a HARQ-ACK information bit, a UE generates a positive acknowledgement (ACK) if the UE detects a DCI format that provides a SPS PDSCH release or detects a DCI format that does not schedule PDSCH reception and indicates a TCI state update or correctly decodes a transport block, and generates a negative acknowledgement (NACK) if the UE does not correctly decode the transport block. A HARQ-ACK information bit value of 0 represents a NACK while a HARQ-ACK information bit value of 1 represents an ACK.\nIn the following, the CRC for a DCI format is scrambled with a C-RNTI, an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI, or a G-RNTI for multicast, or a G-CS-RNTI.\nIn the following, if the value of maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI is not provided, the value of maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI equals one.\n9.1.1\tCBG-based HARQ-ACK codebook determination\nIf a UE is provided PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission for a serving cell, the UE receives a PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1_1, that includes code block groups (CBGs) of a transport block. The UE is also provided maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock indicating a maximum number  of CBGs for generating respective HARQ-ACK information bits for a transport block reception for the serving cell. \nFor a number of  code blocks (CBs) in a transport block, the UE determines a number of CBGs  according to clause 5.1.7.1 of [6, TS 38.214] and determines a number of HARQ-ACK bits for the transport block as . \nThe UE generates an ACK for the HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE correctly received all code blocks of the CBG and generates a NACK for the HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE incorrectly received at least one code block of the CBG. If the UE receives two transport blocks, the UE concatenates the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of the second transport block after the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of the first transport block.\nThe HARQ-ACK codebook includes the  HARQ-ACK information bits in ascending order of CBG index and, if  for a transport block, the UE generates a NACK value for the last  HARQ-ACK information bits for the transport block in the HARQ-ACK codebook. \nIf the UE generates a HARQ-ACK codebook in response to a retransmission of a transport block, corresponding to a same HARQ process as a previous transmission of the transport block, the UE generates an ACK for each CBG that the UE correctly decoded in a previous transmission of the transport block. \nIf a UE correctly detects each of the  CBGs and does not correctly detect the transport block for the  CBGs, the UE generates a NACK value for each of the  CBGs. \n9.1.2\tType-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination\nThis clause applies if the UE is configured with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static. In clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.2.1, and 9.1.2.2, if the UE is configured with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static for only one of unicast or multicast HARQ-ACK codebook, the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook is generated considering only one of respective unicast or multicast configurations for PDSCH receptions or for PDCCH monitoring for detection of DCI formats.\nA UE does not provide a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook if the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook would include only HARQ-ACK information for transport blocks associated with HARQ processes with disabled HARQ-ACK information.\nIf a UE is provided downlinkHARQ-FeedbackDisabled indicating disabled HARQ-ACK information for a HARQ process associated with a transport block in PDSCH reception occasion  on serving cell , the UE reports a NACK value for a HARQ-ACK information bit corresponding to the transport block in a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook and does not consider the transport block as received in the determination of  in clause 9.1.2.1. If the UE is also provided PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission, the UE reports NACK values for HARQ-ACK information bits corresponding to CBGs of the transport block in the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook and does not consider the CBGs as received in the determination of  in clause 9.1.2.1. If the UE is also provided harq-feedbackEnablingforSPSactive = 'enabled', the UE considers a HARQ process associated with a transport block in a first SPS PDSCH reception, after an activation of SPS PDSCH receptions, to have enabled HARQ-ACK information and the UE provides a HARQ-ACK information bit according to a decoding outcome for the transport block in the first SPS PDSCH reception.\nIf a UE reports HARQ-ACK information associated with a G-RNTI for multicast or a G-CS-RNTI with disabled HARQ-ACK information, as described in clause 18, a value of the HARQ-ACK information is a UE implementation choice.\nA UE reports HARQ-ACK information for a corresponding PDSCH reception or SPS PDSCH release or TCI state update only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits in a slot indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a corresponding DCI format or provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17 if the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field is not present in the DCI format as described in clause 9.2.3. The UE reports NACK value(s) for HARQ-ACK information bit(s) in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits in a slot not indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in a corresponding DCI format. \nIf a UE is not provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback, the UE does not expect to receive a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in any PDCCH monitoring occasion and includes a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field providing an inapplicable value from dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17.\nIf the UE is provided pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16 in SPS-Config, or pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-Config and no entry in pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList and pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-1-2 includes repetitionNumber in PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation-r16,  is a maximum value of pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16 in SPS-Config, or pdsch-AggregationFactor in PDSCH-Config; otherwise .

If the UE is provided a periodic cell switching pattern for PUCCH transmissions by pucch-sSCellPattern, the UE determines the slot and a corresponding cell based on the periodic cell switching pattern as described in clause 9.A. The UE multiplexes only the Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook in the PUCCH or the PUSCH for transmission in the slot.

If the UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-EnhType3ToAddModList and the DCI format includes an enhanced Type 3 codebook indicator field that provides a value for pdsch-HARQ-ACK-EnhType3Index, the UE determines a size of a set of indicated serving cells  and a size of a set of indicated HARQ process numbers  for each indicated serving cell  from the entry in pdsch-HARQ-ACK-EnhType3ToAddModList corresponding to the pdsch-HARQ-ACK-EnhType3Index value.

The UE determines  and a resource for the PUCCH transmission as described in clauses 9.2.3 and 9.2.5. If the UE is provided a periodic cell switching pattern for PUCCH transmissions by pucch-sSCellPattern, the UE further determines a corresponding cell based on the periodic cell switching pattern as described in clause 9.A.\nIf the HARQ-ACK retransmission indicator field value in a DCI format is '1', the UE determines slot  as  where  is determined by a one-to-one mapping in ascending order among the values from -7 to 24 and the values of \n-\tthe MCS field for transport block 1 if the DCI format is DCI format 1_1 \n-\tthe MCS field if the DCI format is DCI format 1_2 \n-\tthe MCS field for transport block 1 for a serving cell if the DCI format is DCI format 1_3, where the serving cell is the one with smallest index that has \n-\tresourceAllocation = resourceAllocationType0 and all bits of the corresponding block of the frequency domain resource assignment field equal to 0, or\n-\tresourceAllocation = resourceAllocationType1 and all bits of the corresponding block of the frequency domain resource assignment field equal to 1, or\n-\tresourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch and all bits of the corresponding block of the frequency domain resource assignment field equal to 0 or 1\nIf the DCI format includes a priority indicator field having a value, a priority value of first HARQ-ACK information in the first HARQ-ACK codebook is same as the value of the priority indicator field; otherwise, the priority value of the first HARQ-ACK information is zero.\nIf a UE\n-\tis not provided coresetPoolIndex or is provided coresetPoolIndex with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells, and\n-\tis provided coresetPoolIndex with a value of 1 for second CORESETs on active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and\n-\tis provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate\nthe first HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with the first CORESETs or with the second CORESETs, as described in clause 9, when the UE receives the PDCCH providing the DCI format in a CORESET from the first CORESETs or from the second CORESETs, respectively. \nIf the UE would also multiplex in the PUCCH transmission in slot  a second HARQ-ACK codebook with second HARQ-ACK information of same priority value as for the first HARQ-ACK information in the first HARQ-ACK codebook, the UE appends the first HARQ-ACK codebook to the second HARQ-ACK codebook.

If the UE would also multiplex in the PUCCH transmission in slot  the second HARQ-ACK information with the priority value, the UE appends the first HARQ-ACK information followed by the third HARQ-ACK information to the second HARQ-ACK information.  is the total number of the first HARQ-ACK information bits, the second HARQ-ACK information bits if any and the third HARQ-ACK information bits if any.\nIf in slot  the UE would transmit a first PUCCH with first HARQ-ACK information over more than one slot and a second PUCCH with second HARQ-ACK information over one or more slots, where the first and second HARQ-ACK information have same priority value, the UE multiplexes in the PUCCH transmission in slot  one of\n-\tthe first HARQ-ACK information if the first PUCCH starts at an earlier slot than the second PUCCH, or\n-\tthe second HARQ-ACK information if the second PUCCH starts at an earlier slot than the first PUCCH.\nIf , the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as  where \n-\t is the number of HARQ-ACK information bits that the UE determines as described in clause 9.1.2.1 or 9.1.3.1 for the first HARQ-ACK information bits,\n-\t is the number of HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, that the UE determines as described in clause 9.1.2.1 or 9.1.3.1 for the second HARQ-ACK information bits,\n-\t is determined as described in clause 9.1.2.1 or 9.1.3.1 for the third HARQ-ACK information bits for SPS PDSCH receptions deferred to slot , if any.\n9.2\tUCI reporting in physical uplink control channel\nUCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, LRR, and CSI. UCI bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information bits, if any, LRR information bit, if any, and CSI bits, if any. The HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1. For the remaining of this clause, any reference to SR is applicable for SR and/or for LRR.\nA UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different symbols within a slot. When the UE transmits two PUCCHs in a slot and the UE is not provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate, at least one of the two PUCCHs uses PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 2.\nIf a UE is provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate, the UE may transmit up to two PUCCHs with HARQ-ACK information in different symbols within a slot.\nIn clauses 9.2.3, 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2 and 9.2.5.3, a UE assumes 11 CRC bits if a number of respective UCI bits is larger than or equal to 360; otherwise, the UE determines a number of CRC bits based on the number of respective UCI bits as described in [5, TS 38.212].\n9.2.1\tPUCCH Resource Sets\nIf a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet in PUCCH-Config, a PUCCH resource set is provided by pucch-ResourceCommon through an index to a row of Table 9.2.1-1 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial UL BWP of  PRBs.

If , the UE does not transmit a PUCCH that only includes HARQ-ACK information bits.\nA UE does not expect to transmit more than one PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in a slot per priority index, if the UE is not provided ackNackFeedbackMode = separate. \nFor DCI format 1_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values map to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} for SCS configuration of PUCCH transmission , to {7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32} for , and to {13, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64} for . For a unicast DCI format, other than DCI format 1_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values, if present, map to values for a set of number of slots provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700 as defined in Table 9.2.3-1. If the DCI format indicates a cell for the PUCCH transmission, as described in clause 9.A, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field value maps to slots of the active UL BWP of the cell; otherwise, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field value maps to slots of the active UL BWP of the PCell. For DCI format 4_1, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values are provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDCI-Format4-1 or, if dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDCI-Format4-1 is not provided, by {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. For DCI format 4_2, the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values are provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK from pucch-ConfigMulticast1/pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast1 or pucch-ConfigMulticast2/pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast2 if provided; otherwise, from pucch-Config/pucch-ConfigurationList.\nThe following apply to the PCell if the UE is provided pucch-sSCellPattern; otherwise, the following apply to the serving cell of the PUCCH transmission. If the UE is provided subslotLengthForPUCCH,  is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with a PDSCH reception or with a PDCCH reception providing a DCI format having associated HARQ-ACK information without scheduling a PDSCH reception; otherwise,  is the last UL slot for PUCCH transmission that overlaps with the DL slot  for the PDSCH reception or with the DL slot for the PDCCH reception in case of a DCI format that triggers a HARQ-ACK information report and does not schedule a PDSCH reception.\nFor a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot , the UE transmits the PUCCH in UL slot  where  is provided by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI format activating the SPS PDSCH reception. \nIf the UE detects a DCI format that does not include a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field and schedules a PDSCH reception or activates a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot , the UE provides corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within UL slot  where  is provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700.\nIf the UE detects a DCI format scheduling a number of PDSCH receptions ending in DL slot  or if the UE detects a DCI format generating a HARQ-ACK information bit and does not schedule a PDSCH reception through a PDCCH reception ending in DL slot , the UE provides corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within UL slot , where  is a number of slots and is indicated by the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format, if present, or provided by dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700. \nA PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information is subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1, clause 11.1.1 and clause 17.2. \nTable 9.2.3-1: Mapping of PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field values to numbers of slots\n\nFor a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH resource on the cell of the PUCCH transmission, as described in clause 9.A, after determining a set of PUCCH resources for  HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212], if present, in a last DCI format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDCI-Format4-1, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH. \nThe PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource indicator field of 3 bits, provided by resourceList for PUCCH resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by PUCCH-ResourceSet with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2. If the last DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, the first value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used. \nFor the first set of PUCCH resources and when the size  of resourceList is larger than eight, when a UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to detecting a last DCI format in a PDCCH reception, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among DCI formats with a value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value of dl-DataToUL-ACK, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDCI-Format4-1, or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index , , as\n\t\nwhere  is a number of CCEs in CORESET  of the PDCCH reception for the DCI format as described in clause 10.1,  is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and  is a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format. When the PDCCH reception includes first and second PDCCH candidates from respective first and second search space sets, as described in clause 10.1, the CORESET is associated with the search space set having the smaller index. If\n-\tthe first search space set has larger index than the second search space set and includes the first PDCCH candidate and a third PDCCH candidate that have same first CCE index and CCE aggregation levels 8 and 16, or 16 and 8, respectively,\n-\tthe second search space set includes the second PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the first PDCCH candidate, and a fourth PDCCH candidate that has same index and same CCE aggregation level as the third PDCCH candidate,\n-\tthe CORESET associated with the first search space set has cce-REG-MappingType = 'nonInterleaved' and has duration of one symbol, and\n-\tthe second PDCCH candidate has different first CCE index than the fourth PDCCH candidate \nthe UE determines  from the PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level 16 among the second PDCCH candidate and the fourth PDCCH candidate.\nIf the DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, .\nTable 9.2.3-2: Mapping of PUCCH resource indication field values to a PUCCH resource in a PUCCH resource set with maximum 8 PUCCH resources\n\nIf a UE determines a first resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a PDSCH reception without a corresponding PDCCH or detects a first DCI format indicating a first resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a slot and also detects at a later time a second DCI format indicating a second resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the slot, the UE does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK information corresponding to the second DCI format in a PUCCH resource in the slot if the PDCCH reception that includes the second DCI format is not earlier than  from the beginning of a first symbol of the first resource for PUCCH transmission in the slot where,  and  are defined in clause 4.1 of [4, TS 38.211] and  corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations of the PDCCHs providing the DCI formats and the SCS configuration of the PUCCH.

For PUCCH format 3, if  is not equal  according to [4, TS 38.211],  is increased to the nearest allowed value of nrofPRBs [12, TS 38.331]. If , the UE transmits the PUCCH over  PRBs.\nIf a UE is provided a first interlace of  PRBs by interlace0 in InterlaceAllocation and transmits a PUCCH with  HARQ-ACK information bits and  bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first interlace if ; otherwise, if the UE is provided a second interlace by interlace1 in PUCCH-format2 or PUCCH-format3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first and second interlaces.\n9.2.4\tUE procedure for reporting SR\nA UE can be provided by SchedulingRequestResourceConfig a set of configurations for SR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. \nA UE can be provided by schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell a configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. \nA UE can be provided by schedulingRequestID-BFR a first configuration for LRR and, if the UE provides twoLRRcapability, the UE can be provided by schedulingRequestID-BFR2 a second configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1.\nA UE can be provided by schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell a configuration for consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in [11, TS 38.321], in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can be provided, by phy-PriorityIndex in SchedulingRequestResourceConfig, a priority index 0 or a priority index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR, the priority index is 0.\nThe UE is also provided a periodicity  in symbols or slots and an offset  in slots by periodicityAndOffset for a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If  is larger than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to be in a slot with number  [4, TS 38.211] in a frame with number  if .\nIf  is one slot, the UE expects that  and every slot is a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH. \nIf  is smaller than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to start in a symbol with index  [4, TS 38.211] if  where  is the value of startingSymbolIndex.\nIf the UE determines that, for a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH, the number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission in a slot is smaller than the value provided by nrofSymbols, the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in the slot. \nSR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1, clause 11.1.1 and clause 17.2. \nThe UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by obtaining  as described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting . For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH format 1, the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in [4, TS 38.211] by setting . \n9.2.5\tUE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types\nThis clause is applicable to the case that a UE has resources for PUCCH transmissions or for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions that overlap in time and each PUCCH transmission is over a single slot without repetitions. Any case that a PUCCH transmission is with repetitions over multiple slots is described in clause 9.2.6. If a UE is configured with multiple PUCCH resources in a slot to transmit CSI reports\n-\tif the UE is not provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList or if PUCCH resources for transmissions of CSI reports do not overlap in the slot, the UE determines a first resource corresponding to a CSI report with the highest priority [6, TS 38.214]\n-\tif the first resource includes PUCCH format 2, and if there are remaining resources in the slot that do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting \n-\tif the first resource includes PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4, and if there are remaining resources in the slot that include PUCCH format 2 and do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI reporting\n-\tif the UE is provided multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList and if any of the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports in a resource from the resources provided by multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList, as described in clause 9.2.5.2. \nA UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s) and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the PUCCH. If the UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include DL HARQ-ACK information and CSI report(s), the UE expects to be provided a same configuration for simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI each of PUCCH formats 2, 3, and 4. \nIf a UE would multiplex CSI reports that include Part 2 CSI reports in a PUCCH resource, the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each of the CSI reports and, if any, each CSI sub-report included in a CSI report, indicates rank 1, or rank combination of {1, 1} if applicable. If the higher layer parameter csi-ReportMode of CSI reports is set to 'Mode2', the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of PRBs for the PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming that each CRI in the CSI report is associated with a resource pair. \nIf a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot and, when applicable as described in clauses 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, 9.2.5.3 and 18, the UE is configured to multiplex different UCI types or UCI of different priority indexes in one PUCCH, and at least one of the multiple overlapping PUCCHs or PUSCHs is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE, the UE multiplexes all corresponding UCI types or UCI of different priority indexes if the following conditions are met.

A span is a number of consecutive symbols in a slot where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH. Each PDCCH monitoring occasion is within one span. If a UE monitors PDCCH on a cell according to combination , the UE supports PDCCH monitoring occasions in any symbol of a slot with minimum time separation of  symbols between the first symbol of two consecutive spans, including across slots.

If the UE is configured with a supplementary UL carrier, the UE can be provided an initial UL BWP on the supplementary UL carrier by initialUplinkBWP.\nIf a UE has dedicated BWP configuration, the UE can be provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP for receptions and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP for transmissions on a carrier of the primary cell. \nFor each DL BWP or UL BWP in a set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs, respectively, the UE is provided the following parameters for the serving cell as defined in [4, TS 38.211] or [6, TS 38.214]:\n-\ta SCS by subcarrierSpacing\n-\ta cyclic prefix by cyclicPrefix\n-\ta common RB  and a number of contiguous RBs  provided by locationAndBandwidth that indicates an offset  and a length  as RIV according to [6, TS 38.214], setting , and a value  provided by offsetToCarrier for the subcarrierSpacing\n-\tan index in the set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs by respective BWP-Id\n-\ta set of BWP-common and a set of BWP-dedicated parameters by BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-DownlinkDedicated for the DL BWP, or BWP-UplinkCommon and BWP-UplinkDedicated for the UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]\nFor unpaired spectrum operation, a DL BWP from the set of configured DL BWPs with index provided by BWP-Id is linked with an UL BWP from the set of configured UL BWPs with index provided by BWP-Id when the DL BWP index and the UL BWP index are same. For unpaired spectrum operation, a UE does not expect to receive a configuration where the center frequency for a DL BWP is different than the center frequency for an UL BWP when the BWP-Id of the DL BWP is same as the BWP-Id of the UL BWP.\nFor each DL BWP in a set of DL BWPs of the PCell, a UE can be configured CORESETs for every type of CSS sets and for USS as described in clause 10.1. The UE does not expect to be configured without a CSS set on the PCell in the active DL BWP.\nIf a UE is provided controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero in PDCCH-ConfigSIB1 or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for a search space set from controlResourcesetZero as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-0 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11 through 13-15. If the active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, the UE determines PDCCH monitoring occasions for the search space set only if the CORESET bandwidth is within the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and same cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP.\nFor each UL BWP in a set of UL BWPs of the PCell, or of the PUCCH-SCell, or of the PUCCH-sSCell the UE is configured resource sets for PUCCH transmissions as described in clause 9.2.1. \nA UE receives PDCCH and PDSCH in a DL BWP according to a configured SCS and CP length for the DL BWP. A UE transmits PUCCH and PUSCH in an UL BWP according to a configured SCS and CP length for the UL BWP. \nIf a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active DL BWP, from the configured DL BWP set, for DL receptions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active UL BWP, from the configured UL BWP set, for UL transmissions as described in [5, TS 38.212]. \nIf a bandwidth part indicator field is provided by a DCI format 0_3/1_3, \n-\tthe UE applies for a serving cell the value of the bandwidth part indicator field, if\n-\tthe UE is scheduled by the DCI format 0_3/1_3 to transmit PUSCH/receive PDSCH, respectively, on the serving cell, and\n-\tthe serving cell includes a configured UL/DL BWP with index corresponding to the value of the bandwidth part indicator field, and\n-\tresourceAllocation = resourceAllocationType0 and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the serving cell in the DCI format 0_3/1_3 are equal to 0, or\n-\tresourceAllocation = resourceAllocationType1 and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the serving cell in the DCI format 0_3/1_3 are equal to 1, or\n-\tresourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the serving cell in the DCI format 0_3/1_3 are equal to either 0 or 1, or\n-\tuseInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH is provided and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the serving cell in the DCI format 0_3 are equal to 1 for  or are not equal to 0 for \n-\totherwise, the UE does not apply for the serving cell the value of the bandwidth part indicator field.\nThe UE does not expect to be scheduled by a DCI format 1_3 to receive a PDSCH on an activated SCell, if:\n-\tthe DCI format 1_3 indicates an active DL BWP provided by dormantBWP-Id for the activated SCell, and\n-\tresourceAllocation = resourceAllocationType0 and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the activated SCell in the DCI format 1_3 are equal to 0, or\n-\tresourceAllocation = resourceAllocationType1 and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the activated SCell in the DCI format 1_3 are equal to 1, or\n-\tresourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch and not all bits of a block of the frequency domain resource assignment field associated with the activated SCell in the DCI format 1_3 are equal to either 0 or 1.\nIf a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format and indicates an UL BWP or a DL BWP different from the active UL BWP or DL BWP, respectively, the UE shall\n-\tfor each information field in the DCI format \n-\tif the size of the information field is smaller than the one required for the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, the UE prepends zeros to the information field until its size is the one required for the interpretation of the information field for the UL BWP or DL BWP prior to interpreting the DCI format information fields, respectively\n-\tif the size of the information field is larger than the one required for the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, the UE uses a number of least significant bits of the DCI format equal to the one required for the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by bandwidth part indicator prior to interpreting the DCI format information fields, respectively\n-\tfor a DCI format 0_3, or for a DCI format 1_3, and for an information field that includes a number of blocks [5, TS 38.212], the above procedures apply separately for each block of the information field \n-\tset the active UL BWP or DL BWP to the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by the bandwidth part indicator in the DCI format \nIf a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format 0_1/0_3 and indicates an active UL BWP with different SCS configuration , or with different number  of RB sets for a serving cell, than a current active UL BWP for the serving cell, the UE determines an uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 for the serving cell based on  bits and  bits that are generated by independently truncating or padding the  MSBs and the  LSBs [6, TS 38.214] of the frequency domain resource assignment field of DCI format 0_1, or the block of the frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 0_3 corresponding to the serving cell, where truncation starts from the MSBs of the X bits or the Y bits, zero-padding prepends zeros to the X bits or the Y bits, and\n-\tif the indicated active UL BWP for the serving cell has SCS configuration  and the current active BWP for the serving cell has SCS configuration , the  MSBs are truncated to  bits, or\n-\tif the indicated active UL BWP for the serving cell has SCS configuration  and the current active BWP for the serving cell has SCS configuration , the  MSBs are zero-padded to  bits \n-\totherwise, the  MSBs are unchanged\nand\n-\tthe  LSBs are truncated or zero-padded to  bits where  is a number of RB sets configured for the indicated active UL BWP for the serving cell.\nA UE does not expect to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP change with the corresponding time domain resource assignment field providing a slot offset value for a PDSCH reception or PUSCH transmission that is smaller than a delay required by the UE for an active DL BWP change or UL BWP change, respectively [10, TS 38.133]. \nIf a UE detects a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active DL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in a scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.\nIf a UE detects a DCI format with SCell dormancy indication that indicates an active DL BWP change for an Scell in slot n of primary cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the SCell during a time duration specified in [10, TS 38.133].\nIf a UE detects a DCI format indicating an active UL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in the scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.\nA UE does not expect to detect a DCI format indicating an active DL BWP change or an active UL BWP change for a scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2) in a slot other than the first slot of a set of slots for the DL SCS of the scheduling cell that overlaps with a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit, respectively, for an active BWP change in a different cell from the scheduled cell within FR1 (or FR2).\nA UE expects to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates an active UL BWP change or an active DL BWP change only if a corresponding PDCCH is received within the first 3 symbols of a slot. If the UE detects the DCI format from two PDCCH receptions in search space sets  and  that include searchSpaceLinkingId with same value, as described in clause 10.1, the UE considers the PDCCH reception where the UE detects the DCI format to be the one from the two PDCCH receptions that ends later.\nFor a serving cell, a UE can be provided by defaultDownlinkBWP-Id a default DL BWP among the configured DL BWPs. If a UE is not provided a default DL BWP by defaultDownlinkBWP-Id, the default DL BWP is the initial DL BWP. \nIf a UE is provided by bwp-InactivityTimer a timer value for the serving cell [11, TS 38.321] and the timer is running, the UE decrements the timer at the end of a subframe for FR1 or at the end of a half subframe for FR2 if the restarting conditions in [11, TS 38.321] are not met during the interval of the subframe for FR1 or of the half subframe for FR2.\nFor a cell where a UE changes an active DL BWP due to a BWP inactivity timer expiration and for accommodating a delay in the active DL BWP change or the active UL BWP change required by the UE [10, TS 38.133], the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time duration from the beginning of a subframe for FR1, or of half of a subframe for FR2, that is immediately after the BWP inactivity timer expires until the beginning of a slot where the UE can receive or transmit.\nWhen a UE's BWP inactivity timer for a cell within FR1 (or FR2) expires within a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or transmit for an active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in a different cell within FR1 (or FR2), the UE delays the active UL/DL BWP change triggered by the BWP inactivity timer expiration until a subframe for FR1 or half a subframe for FR2 that is immediately after the UE completes the active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in the different cell within FR1 (or FR2).\nIf a UE is provided by firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id a first active DL BWP and by firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a secondary cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL BWP as the respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and first active UL BWP on the carrier of the secondary cell. \nIf a UE is provided NonCellDefiningSSB in BWP-DownlinkDedicated for an active DL BWP, the UE assumes that the active DL BWP includes the SS/PBCH blocks provided by NonCellDefiningSSB. The SS/PBCH blocks provided by NonCellDefiningSSB and the SS/PBCH blocks that the UE used to obtain SIB1 have same QCL properties if they have a same index. Unless otherwise stated, handling of overlapping between downlink receptions or uplink transmissions and the SS/PBCH blocks provided by NonCellDefiningSSB is same as handling of overlapping between downlink receptions or uplink transmissions and the SS/PBCH blocks provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 or in ServingCellConfigCommon. The SS/PBCH blocks in Clause 11.1 for resolving directional collisions for a set of serving cells among multiple serving cells, when the UE is provided directionalCollisionHandling and indicates support of half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS, correspond to the SS/PBCH blocks the UE used to obtain SIB1.\nA UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH when the UE performs RRM measurements [10, TS 38.133] over a bandwidth that is not within the active DL BWP for the UE.\n13\tUE procedure for monitoring Type0-PDCCH CSS sets\nIf during cell search a UE determines from MIB that a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in clause 4.1, the UE determines a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of consecutive symbols for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from controlResourceSetZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1, as described in Tables 13-0 through 13-10, for operation without shared spectrum channel access in FR1 and FR2-1, or as described in Tables 13-1A and 13-4A for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, or as described in Table 13-10A for FR2-2, and determines PDCCH monitoring occasions from searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1, included in MIB, as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15A.  and  are the SFN and slot index within a frame of the CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET and  and  are the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the CORESET, respectively, where the SS/PBCH block with index  overlaps in time with system frame  and slot . The symbols of the CORESET associated with pdcch-ConfigSIB1 in MIB or with searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix. In Table 13-0, configurations with index 0 to 9 are applicable when an associated SS/PBCH block is located according to Table 5.4.3.3-2 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], configurations with index 10 to 11 are applicable when an associated SS/PBCH block is located according to NOTE 12 of Table 5.4.3.3-1 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping applies for configurations with index 6 to 9. In Table 13-1, the associated SS/PBCH block is not located according to NOTE 12 of Table 5.4.3.3-1 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1].\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2 and for operation without shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that the offset in Tables 13-0 through 13-10A is defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set from the smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to the smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block, after puncturing if any [4, TS 38.211]. The SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is provided by subCarrierSpacingCommon for FR1 and FR2-1 and same as the SCS of the corresponding SS/PBCH block for FR2-2. In Tables 13-7, 13-8, and 13-10,  is defined in [4, TS 38.211]. \nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, a UE determines an offset from a smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with a first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block\n-\taccording to the offset in Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, if the frequency position of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], and\n-\taccording to a sum of a first offset and a second offset if the frequency position of the SS/PBCH block is provided by ssbFrequency in a measurement configuration associated with a reporting configuration providing reportCGI and does not correspond to the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry as defined in [8-1, TS 38.101-1], where\n-\tthe first offset is provided in Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, and \n-\tthe second offset is determined as the offset from a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the SS/PBCH block indicated in the measurement configuration to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of a SS/PBCH block hypothetically located at the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry, where the single synchronization raster entry is located in the same channel as the SS/PBCH block used for the shared spectrum channel access procedure, as described in [15, TS 37.213]\nwhere the offsets are defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set that is same as the SCS of the corresponding SS/PBCH block.\nFor operation without shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over two slots. For SS/PBCH block with index , the UE determines an index of slot  as  that is in a frame with system frame number (SFN)  satisfying  if , or in a frame with SFN satisfying  if  where  based on the SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211].\n-\tFor  and for a SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-11 and Table 13-12.\n-\tFor  and for a SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-12A, where .\n-\tFor  and for a SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-12A, where .\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over slots that include Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with SS/PBCH blocks that are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'typeA' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable [6, TS 38.214]. For a candidate SS/PBCH block index , where , two slots include the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions. The UE determines an index of slot  as  that is in a frame with system frame number (SFN)  satisfying  if , or in a frame with SFN satisfying  if  where  based on the SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET [4, TS 38.211]. \n-\tFor  and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-11. The UE does not expect to be configured with , or with , when .\n-\tFor  and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-12.\n-\tFor  and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-12A, where .\n-\tFor  and for a candidate SS/PBCH block index , the two slots including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions are slots  and . , , and the index of the first symbol of the CORESET in slots  and  are provided by Table 13-12A, where .\nFor operation without shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over one slot with Type0-PDCCH CSS set periodicity equal to the periodicity of SS/PBCH block. For a SS/PBCH block with index , the UE determines the slot index  and  based on parameters provided by Tables 13-13 through 13-15A.\nFor operation with shared spectrum channel access and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 3, a UE monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over slots that include Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with SS/PBCH blocks that are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set with respect to average gain, quasi co-location 'typeA' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable. For a candidate SS/PBCH block index , where , the periodicity of the slot including the associated Type0-PDCCH monitoring occasion is same as the periodicity of the candidate SS/PBCH block, and the UE determines the slot index  and  based on parameters provided by Tables 13-15 and 13-15A, where  is replaced by  for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2.\nFor the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, if the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, the UE is expected to be able to perform radio link monitoring, as described in clause 5, and measurements for radio resource management [10, TS 38.133] using a SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set.\nTable 13-0: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {15, 15} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 3 MHz and channel bandwidth 3 MHz or 5 MHz.\n\nTable 13-1: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {15, 15} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 5 MHz or 10 MHz or with minimum channel bandwidth 3 MHz and channel bandwidth larger than 3 MHz\n\nTable 13-1A: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {15, 15} kHz for frequency bands operated with shared spectrum channel access\n\nTable 13-2: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {15, 30} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 5 MHz or 10 MHz\n\nTable 13-3: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {30, 15} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 5 MHz or 10 MHz except for the frequency bands defined by note 17 of Table 5.2-1 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]\n\nTable 13-4: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {30, 30} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 5 MHz or 10 MHz except for the frequency bands defined by note 17 of Table 5.2-1 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]\n\nTable 13-4A: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {30, 30} kHz for frequency bands operated with shared spectrum channel access\n\nTable 13-5: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {30, 15} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 40MHz or for the frequency bands defined by note 17 of Table 5.2-1 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]\n\nTable 13-6: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {30, 30} kHz for frequency bands with minimum channel bandwidth 40MHz or for the frequency bands defined by note 17 of Table 5.2-1 in [8-1, TS 38.101-1]\n\nTable 13-7: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {120, 60} kHz\n\nTable 13-8: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {120, 120} kHz for FR2-1\n\nTable 13-9: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {240, 60} kHz\n\nTable 13-10: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {240, 120} kHz\n\nTable 13-10A: Set of resource blocks and slot symbols of CORESET for Type0-PDCCH search space set when {SS/PBCH block, PDCCH} SCS is {120, 120} kHz, {480, 480} kHz, or {960, 960} kHz for FR2-2\n\nTable 13-11: Parameters for PDCCH monitoring occasions for Type0-PDCCH CSS set -

that the UE generates based on HARQ-ACK information that the UE obtains from PSFCH receptions, or from absence of PSFCH receptions. The UE reports HARQ-ACK information on the primary cell of the PUCCH group, as described in clause 9, of the cell where the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of DCI format 3_0.\nFor SL configured grant Type 1 or Type 2 PSSCH transmissions by a UE within a time period provided by sl-PeriodCG, the UE generates one HARQ-ACK information bit in response to the PSFCH receptions to multiplex in a PUCCH transmission occasion that is after a last time resource, in a set of time resources. \nFor PSSCH transmissions scheduled by a DCI format 3_0, a UE generates HARQ-ACK information in response to PSFCH receptions to multiplex in a PUCCH transmission occasion that is after a last time resource in a set of time resources provided by the DCI format 3_0.\nFrom a number of PSFCH reception occasions, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission. The UE can be indicated by a SCI format to perform one of the following and the UE constructs a HARQ-ACK codeword with HARQ-ACK information, when applicable \n-\tfor one or more PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"10\"\n-\tgenerate HARQ-ACK information with same value as a value of HARQ-ACK information the UE determines from the last PSFCH reception from the number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions or, if the UE determines that a PSFCH is not received at the last PSFCH reception occasion and ACK is not received in any of previous PSFCH reception occasions, generate NACK\n-\tfor one or more PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"01\" \n-\tgenerate ACK if the UE determines ACK from at least one PSFCH reception occasion, from the number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions, in PSFCH resources corresponding to every identity  of the UEs that the UE expects to receive the PSSCH, as described in clause 16.3; otherwise, generate NACK \n-\tfor one or more PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI format 2-B or SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"11\"\n-\tgenerate ACK when the UE determines absence of PSFCH reception for the last PSFCH reception occasion from the number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions; otherwise, generate NACK \nAfter a UE transmits PSSCHs and receives PSFCHs in corresponding PSFCH resource occasions, the priority value of HARQ-ACK information is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmissions that is associated with the PSFCH reception occasions providing the HARQ-ACK information.\nThe UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization, as described in clause 16.2.4, the UE does not receive PSFCH in any PSFCH reception occasion associated with a PSSCH transmission in a resource provided by a DCI format 3_0 and the UE transmitted PSSCH in the resource or, for a configured grant, in a resource provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information and the UE transmitted PSSCH in the resource. The priority value of the NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmission.\nThe UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization as described in clause 16.2.4, or due to a failed channel access procedure [15, TS 37.213] for operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not transmit a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI format 3_0 or, for a configured grant, in any of the resources provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH that was not transmitted due to prioritization or due to the failed channel access procedure.\nThe UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a configured grant in a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority values for the configured grant.\nThe UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI format 3_0 and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority values for the dynamic grant.\nFor reporting HARQ-ACK information on uplink corresponding to one or multiple PSSCH transmissions with a corresponding SCI format with the field 'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator' set to disabled, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information with the contents instructed by higher layer. The priority value of the HARQ-ACK information is same as the priority value of the PSSCH transmission.\nA UE does not expect to be provided PUCCH resources or PUSCH resources to report HARQ-ACK information that start earlier than   after the end of a last symbol of a last PSFCH reception occasion if numPSFCHOccasions is not (pre-)configured, or of a last candidate PSFCH reception occasion if numPSFCHOccasions is (pre-)configured, from a number of PSFCH reception occasions if numPSFCHOccasions is not (pre-)configured, or from a number of candidate PSFCH reception occasions if numPSFCHOccasions is (pre-)configured, that the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission, where\n-\t and  are defined in [4, TS 38.211]\n-\t, where  is the SCS configuration of the SL BWP and  is the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP on the primary cell \n-\t is determined from  according to Table 16.5-1 \nTable 16.5-1: Values of  \n\nFor DCI format 3_0, if present, the PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field values map to values for a set of number of slots provided by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH as defined in Table 16.5-2.\nTable 16.5-2: Mapping of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field values to numbers of slots\n\nWith reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions and for a number of PSFCH reception occasions if numPSFCHOccasions is not (pre-)configured, or candidate PSFCH reception occasions if numPSFCHOccasions is (pre-)configured, ending in slot , the UE provides the generated HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within slot , subject to the overlapping conditions in clause 9.2.5, where  is a number of slots indicated by a PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI format indicating a slot for PUCCH transmission to report the HARQ-ACK information, or  is provided by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH for a transmission scheduled by a DCI format or for a SL configured grant type 2, or by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1 for a SL configured grant type 1.  corresponds to a last slot for a PUCCH transmission that would overlap with the last PSFCH reception occasion if numPSFCHOccasions is not (pre-)configured, or the last candidate PSFCH reception occasion if numPSFCHOccasions is (pre-)configured, assuming that the start of the sidelink frame is same as the start of the downlink frame [4, TS 38.211].\nFor a PSSCH transmission by a UE that is scheduled by a DCI format, or for a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission activated by a DCI format, the DCI format indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a corresponding PDCCH, the DCI format activating the SL configured grant Type 2 indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For a SL configured grant Type 1 PSSCH transmission, a PUCCH resource can be provided by sl-N1PUCCH-AN and sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1. For transmission of HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission, including the PSSCH transmission(s) associated with the corresponding activation DCI format 3_0, a UE can be provided a PUCCH resource by sl-N1PUCCH-AN-Type2. If a PUCCH resource is not provided, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH with generated HARQ-ACK information from PSFCH reception occasions. \nFor a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a PUCCH resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources from up to four PUCCH resource sets provided by sl-PUCCH-Config, for  HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource indicator field [5, TS 38.212] in a last DCI format 3_0, excluding DCI format 3_0 for the SL configured grant Type 2 activation, among the DCI formats 3_0 that have a value of a PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource determination, detected DCI formats are indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH monitoring occasion indexes.\nThe PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of PUCCH resource indexes, as described in clause 9.2.3.\nA UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1 or PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 as described in clause 9.2.3.\nA UE does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK information for more than one SL configured grants in a same PUCCH. \nA priority value of a PUCCH transmission with one or more sidelink HARQ-ACK information bits is the smallest priority value for the one or more HARQ-ACK information bits.\nIn the following, the CRC for DCI format 3_0 is scrambled with a SL-RNTI or a SL-CS-RNTI.\n16.5.1\tType-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination \nThis clause applies if the UE is configured with pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static.\nIf a UE is configured a SL configured grant Type 1, and the UE is configured a SL configured grant Type 2 or to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 3_0 with CRC scrambled by SL-RNTI or SL-CS-RNTI, and the UE is provided a set of slot timing values  associated with a SL BWP by sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH and sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1, the sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1 is one of sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH.\nA UE reports HARQ-ACK information for PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions in slot  only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE includes in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission in slot , where  is a number of slots indicated by the PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field in a DCI format 3_0 scheduling the PSSCH transmissions, or by a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field in a DCI format 3_0 activating a SL configured grant Type-2 transmission, or by a value of sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1 for a SL configured grant Type-1.

A UE can be provided a DL BWP by initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap in DownlinkConfigCommonSIB, and an UL BWP by initialUplinkBWP-RedCap in UplinkConfigCommonSIB. If initialUplinkBWP in UplinkConfigCommonSIB indicates an UL BWP that is larger than a maximum UL BWP that a UE supports, the UE expects to be provided an UL BWP by initialUplinkBWP-RedCap in UplinkConfigCommonSIB that is smaller than or equal to the maximum UL bandwidth that the UE supports.\nFor unpaired spectrum operation, a RedCap UE does not expect to receive a configuration where the center frequency for an initial DL BWP in which the UE is configured to monitor Type1-PDCCH CSS set, or a CSS set provided by sdt-SearchSpace for random-access based PUSCH transmission as described in clause 19.2, is different than the center frequency for an initial UL BWP in which the RedCap UE may transmit Msg1/Msg3 or MsgA.\nA UE can be provided by BWP-DownlinkDedicated a DL BWP, other than the initial DL BWP. A UE can be provided by BWP-UplinkDedicated an UL BWP, other than the initial UL BWP, that is smaller than or equal to the maximum UL bandwidth that the UE supports. \nIf a UE is provided an UL BWP by initialUplinkBWP-RedCap in UplinkConfigCommonSIB and is provided rach-ConfigCommon or msgA-ConfigCommon in BWP-UplinkCommon for the UL BWP, the UE uses corresponding parameters to perform the procedures in clauses 8.1, 8.1A, and 8.3; otherwise, the UE uses corresponding parameters from rach-ConfigCommon or msgA-ConfigCommon in BWP-UplinkCommon for the UL BWP provided by initialUplinkBWP.\nIf a UE is provided initialUplinkBWP-RedCap in UplinkConfigCommonSIB and does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE transmits PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.2.1 using a PUCCH resource set provided by pucch-ResourceCommonRedCap, except that frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission is disabled if intra-SlotFH is present in PUCCH-ConfigCommon.

For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode and for a transport block that a UE received in a SPS PDSCH, a PDSCH reception providing a retransmission of the transport block can be scheduled either by a unicast DCI format using a CS-RNTI or by a multicast DCI format using a same G-CS-RNTI as the G-CS-RNTI of the initial transmission of the transport block [6, TS 38.214].\nFor a DCI format indicating SPS PDSCH release, the UE provides the associated HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.1.\nA UE can be configured per G-RNTI for multicast or per G-CS-RNTI, by harq-FeedbackEnablerMulticast with value set to 'enabled', to provide HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH receptions. When the UE is not provided harq-FeedbackEnablerMulticast for a G-RNTI for multicast or G-CS-RNTI and pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic for multicast HARQ-ACK information, the UE does not provide HARQ-ACK information for respective PDSCH receptions.

If the UE would multiplex the second multicast HARQ-ACK information, for resolving an overlapping among a second PUCCH with the second HARQ-ACK information and other PUCCHs or PUSCHs prior to multiplexing the second HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH, the UE considers that the UE would transmit the second PUCCH when all values of the HARQ-ACK information are 'ACK'. If the UE would multiplex the second multicast HARQ-ACK information, for resolving an overlapping among a second PUCCH with the second HARQ-ACK information and other PUCCHs or PUSCHs prior to multiplexing the second HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH when the UE is provided moreThanOneNackOnlyMode, the UE considers that the UE would transmit the second PUCCH using any PUCCH resource from the PUCCH resources associated with the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode when all values of the second HARQ-ACK information are 'ACK'. \nIf a UE would only transmit a first PUCCH with only positive SR and a second PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information according to the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, where the first and second PUCCHs would overlap in time in a slot and have same priority index, it is up to UE implementation for the UE to transmit either the first PUCCH or the second PUCCH.\nIf a UE is provided multiple G-RNTIs for multicast or G-CS-RNTIs, a configuration for a HARQ-ACK codebook type applies to all G-RNTIs for multicast or G-CS-RNTIs.\nIf a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static for multicast HARQ-ACK information, the UE generates a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.2.1, and 9.1.2.2.\nIf a UE is provided pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic for multicast HARQ-ACK information, the UE generates a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clauses 9.1.3.1 and 9.1.3.2. \nIf a UE would report unicast HARQ-ACK information and multicast HARQ-ACK information with same priority index in a slot, the UE multiplexes the unicast HARQ-ACK information and the multicast HARQ-ACK information following the procedures in this clause and in clauses 9.1.2, 9.1.3, and 9.1.4.\nIf, for unicast and multicast HARQ-ACK information of same priority value, a UE\n-\tis provided \n-\teither pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic or pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16 for unicast HARQ-ACK information and pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static for multicast HARQ-ACK information, \n-\tor pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static or pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16 for unicast HARQ-ACK information and pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic for multicast HARQ-ACK information, and\n-\twould multiplex the unicast and multicast HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH or PUSCH \nthe UE \n-\tappends the HARQ-ACK codebooks for the multicast HARQ-ACK information to the HARQ-ACK codebooks for the unicast HARQ-ACK information\n-\tif , the UE determines  for obtaining a power of a PUCCH transmission with the HARQ-ACK information, as described in clause 7.2.1, as a sum of the  value from clause 9.1.3.1 or clause 9.1.3.3 and the  value from clause 9.1.2.1 or as a sum of the  value from clause 9.1.2.1 or clause 9.1.3.3 and the  value from clause 9.1.3.1.\nA UE determines a PUCCH resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information as described in clauses 9.2 and 9.2.1 through 9.2.5. \nIf a UE multiplexes in a PUCCH HARQ-ACK information of same priority associated with unicast DCI formats and with multicast DCI formats in a same PUCCH, the last DCI format that the UE uses to determine the PUCCH resource from pucch-Config/pucch-ConfigurationList, as described in clause 9.2.3, is a last unicast DCI format.\nIf the UE multiplexes in a PUCCH only multicast HARQ-ACK information of same priority that is according to both the first and second HARQ-ACK reporting modes, the last DCI format that the UE uses to determine the PUCCH resource from pucch-ConfigMulticast1/pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast1, if provided; otherwise, from pucch-Config/pucch-ConfigurationList, as described in clause 9.2.3, is a last DCI format associated with multicast HARQ-ACK information that is according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode.\nIf a UE multiplexes in a PUCCH only first HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast SPS PDSCH receptions and second HARQ-ACK information associated with multicast DCI formats and having same priority value as the first HARQ-ACK information, and both the first and second HARQ-ACK information are according to the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE determines the PUCCH resource based on the last multicast DCI format from pucch-ConfigMulticast1/pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast1, if provided;

For the remaining of this clause, PUSCH transmissions refer to configured grant Type-1 PUSCH transmissions for a configuration provided by ConfiguredGrantConfig. \nA UE can be provided by sdt-SSB-Subset a number of SS/PBCH block indexes  to map to a number of valid PUSCH occasions for PUSCH transmissions over an association period. If the UE is not provided sdt-SSB-Subset, the UE determines  from the value of ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1. A PUSCH occasion for a PUSCH transmission is defined by a time resource and a frequency resource and is associated with a DM-RS provided by cg-DMRS-Configuration for the configuration of PUSCH transmissions. A UE can be provided a number of repetitions for a PUSCH transmission by repK or numberOfRepetitions. If the number of repetitions is provided and larger than 1, all the PUSCH occasions of the repetitions for the PUSCH transmission are mapped to the same SS/PBCH block index(es). All the PUSCH occasions of the repetitions are not valid if any PUSCH occasion of the repetitions is not valid. \nAn association period, starting from frame with SFN 0 and hyper frame with hyper SFN 0, for mapping  SS/PBCH block indexes, from the number of SS/PBCH block indexes, to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources is the smallest value in the set determined by the PUSCH configuration period provided by periodicity\u00a0in ConfiguredGrantConfig according to Table 19.1-1 such that  SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources within the association period. A UE is provided a number of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with a PUSCH occasion and a DM-RS resource by sdt-SSB-PerCG-PUSCH. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH block indexes to PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources that are not mapped to  SS/PBCH block indexes, no SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources. An association pattern period, when PUSCH configuration period is no longer than 640 msec, includes one or more association periods and is determined so that a pattern between PUSCH occasions with associated DMRS resources and SS/PBCH block indexes repeats at most every 640 msec. PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources not associated with SS/PBCH block indexes after an integer number of association periods, if any, are not used for PUSCH transmissions.\nTable 19.1-1: Mapping between PUSCH configuration period and SS/PBCH block to configured PUSCH resource association period\n SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources in the following order\n-\tfirst, in increasing order of DMRS resource indexes within a PUSCH occasion, where a DMRS resource index  is determined first in an ascending order of a DMRS port index and second in an ascending order of a DMRS sequence index [4, TS 38.211]\n-\tsecond, in increasing order of PUSCH configuration period indexes\nA PUSCH occasion is valid if it does not overlap with a valid PRACH occasion as described in clause 8.1. \nFor unpaired spectrum and for SS/PBCH blocks with indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1\n-\tif a UE is not provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion\n-\tdoes not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and \n-\tstarts at least  symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where  is provided in Table 8.1-2\n-\tif a UE is provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon, a PUSCH occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion\n-\tis within UL symbols\n-\tstarts at least  symbols after a last downlink symbol, and at least  symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where  is provided in Table 8.1-2\nA UE determines a power of a PUSCH transmission as described in clause 7.1.1, where the UE obtains  using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH block with index associated with the PUSCH transmission. \nA UE can be provided a USS set by SearchSpace, or a CSS set by sdt-SearchSpace, to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or CS-RNTI for scheduling PUSCH transmission or of DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI for scheduling PDSCH receptions [12, TS 38.331]. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDCCH receptions, the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDSCH receptions, and the SS/PBCH block associated with the PUSCH transmission are quasi co-located with respect to average gain and quasi co-location 'typeA' or 'typeD' properties. The UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information associated with the PDSCH receptions as described in clause 9.2.1 using a same spatial domain transmission filter as for the last PUSCH transmission.\nFor initial transmission or autonomous retransmission of an initial transport block provided for the PUSCH transmission as described in clause 18.0 in [19, TS 38.300], the UE encodes the transport block using redundancy version number 0 if the UE is not provided repK-RV.\n19.2\tRandom-access based PUSCH transmission\nA UE indicated to release a dedicated RRC connection can be provided a configuration for a Type-1 and/or a Type-2 random access procedure on the initial UL BWP [12, TS 38.331].

A PRACH transmission can be on a subset of PRACH occasions associated with a same SS/PBCH block index within an SSB-RO mapping cycle as determined by a PRACH mask index provided by ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex according to [11, TS 38.321]. \nA UE can be provided by sdt-SearchSpace a CSS set to monitor, after contention resolution as described in clause 8.4, PDCCH for detection of a DCI format 0_0 or DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI for scheduling respective PUSCH transmissions or PDSCH receptions; otherwise, if the UE is not provided sdt-SearchSpace, the UE monitors PDCCH according to a Type1-PDCCH CSS set as described in clause 10.1. The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDCCH receptions, the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDSCH receptions, and the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH transmission are quasi co-located with respect to average gain and quasi co-location 'typeA' or 'typeD' properties.\n20\tNetwork controlled repeater\nAn NCR includes an NCR-MT entity and an NCR-Fwd entity [19, TS 38.300]. \nThroughout this specification, unless otherwise noted, statements using the term \"UE\" in Clauses 4 through 13 are equally applicable to the NCR-MT. \nA procedure for the NCR-MT to perform cell search, system information acquisition, random access procedure, UCI reporting, or PDCCH monitoring is same as a corresponding one for a UE. A procedure for the NCR-MT to perform PDSCH reception, CSI-RS measurements and CSI determination, PUSCH transmission, or SRS transmission is same as a corresponding one for a UE as described in [6, TS 38.214].\nThe NCR-Fwd transmits or receives only after the NCR-MT receives on the control link an indication for one or more beams [20, TS 38.106] for the NCR-Fwd to use for transmissions or receptions over corresponding one or more time resources on the access link. \nThe timing for transmission and reception by the NCR-Fwd on the backhaul link follows the frame timing for transmission and reception, respectively, by the NCR-MT.\nWhen the NCR-MT performs a link recovery procedure as described in Clause 6, the NCR-Fwd does not transmit or receive until the link recovery procedure is complete [11, TS 38.321].\nThe NCR can be provided, through the NCR-MT, tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and can be additionally provided tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated. The NCR-Fwd receives on the backhaul link or transmits on the access link only in symbols indicated as downlink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and, if provided, tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated. The NCR-Fwd receives on the access link or transmits on the backhaul link only in symbols indicated as uplink by tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and, if provided, tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated.\nIf the NCR does not support simultaneous transmissions on control link and the backhaul link, the NCR-Fwd does not transmit over a time resource if the NCR-MT transmits over the time resource.\nWhen the NCR simultaneously receives via both the control link and the backhaul link in a set of symbols, a TCI state for receptions on the backhaul link is same as a TCI state for receptions on the control link in the set of symbols. When the NCR simultaneously transmits via both the control link and the backhaul link in a set of symbols, a spatial filter for transmissions on the backhaul link is same as a spatial filter for transmissions on the control link in the set of symbols.\nWhen the NCR does not simultaneously receive on the control link and the backhaul link\n-\tif the NCR does not support determination of a TCI state for receptions on the backhaul link based on an indication of a TCI state by the serving cell, or if the NCR does not receive an indication of a TCI state, for receptions on the backhaul link [11, TS 38.321]\n-\tif the NCR does not receive an indication of a unified TCI state for receptions by the NCR-MT, receptions on the backhaul link use same QCL parameters as the ones for PDCCH receptions in a CORESET with the lowest controlResourceSetId in the active DL BWP\n-\telse, receptions on the backhaul link use the QCL parameters provided by an indicated unified TCI state for receptions by the NCR-MT \n-\telse receptions on the backhaul link use QCL parameters provided by a TCI state in NCR Downlink Backhaul Link Beam Indication MAC CE [11, TS 38.321].\nWhen the NCR does not simultaneously transmit on the control link and the backhaul link\n-\tif the NCR does not support determination of a spatial filter for transmissions on the backhaul link based on an indication of a unified TCI state or of an SRI by the serving cell, or if the NCR-MT does not receive an indication of a unified TCI state or of an SRI for determining a spatial filter, for transmissions on the backhaul link\n-\tif the NCR does not receive an indication of a unified TCI state for transmissions by the NCR-MT, transmissions on the backhaul link use a same spatial filter as the one associated with the PUCCH resource with the smallest pucch-ResourceId in PUCCH-ResourceSet in the active UL BWP\n-\telse, transmissions on the backhaul link use a spatial filter corresponding to the indicated unified TCI state for transmissions by the NCR-MT. \n-\telse transmissions on the backhaul link use a spatial filter corresponding to a unified TCI state or an SRI provided in NCR Uplink Backhaul Link Beam Indication MAC CE [11, TS 38.321].\nIf the NCR receives an indication of a TCI state for receptions on the backhaul link in a MAC CE command, or an indication of a unified TCI state or of an SRI for determining a spatial filter for transmissions on the backhaul link in a MAC CE command, the NCR applies the MAC CE command from the first slot that is after slot  where  is the slot where the NCR-MT would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information associated with the PDSCH providing the MAC CE command,  is a number of slots per subframe for the SCS configuration  of the PUCCH transmission.\nThe NCR-Fwd uses a same beam for transmissions and receptions on the access link during respective time resources associated with a same beam index.\nThe NCR can be provided by periodicFwdRsrcSetToAddModList a list of sets of resources for transmissions or receptions on the access link. A set of resources, from the list of sets of resources, is provided by NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet and occurs with a periodicity provided by periodicityAndOffset-r18. A resource from the set of resources is provided by NCR-PeriodicFwdResource and includes a pair of a time resource provided by periodicTimeRsrc and a beam [20, TS 38.106] with an index provided by beamIndex. The time resource starts at a slot that is offset by a number of slots provided by periodicityAndOffset-r18 from the start of the period for the set of resources and at a symbol that is offset by symbolOffset from the start of the slot, and has a duration provided by durationInSymbols for a SCS provided by referenceSCS and the cyclicPrefix of the active DL BWP. \nThe NCR can be provided by semiPersistentFwdRsrcSetToAddModList a list of sets of resources for transmissions or receptions on the access link and the NCR Access Link Beam Indication MAC CE command can indicate a set of resources for the NCR to use or to stop using based on a corresponding identity provided by semiPersistentFwdRsrcSetId [11, TS 38.321]. The NCR uses or stops using the set of resources starting from the first slot that is after slot  where  is the slot where the NCR-MT would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information associated with the PDSCH providing the MAC CE command and  is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH transmission. The set of resources is provided by NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResourceSet and occurs with a periodicity provided by periodicityAndOffset-r18. A resource from the set of resources is provided by NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResource and includes a pair of a time resource provided by semiPersistentTimeRsrc and a beam with an index provided by beamIndex, where beamIndex can be updated by the NCR Access Link Beam Indication MAC CE command. The time resource starts at a slot that is offset by a number of slots provided by periodicityAndOffset-r18 from the start of the period for the set of resources and at a symbol that is offset by symbolOffset from the start of the slot, and has a duration provided by durationInSymbols for a SCS provided by referenceSCS and the cyclicPrefix of the active DL BWP. \nThe NCR-MT can be configured to monitor PDCCH according to USS sets for detection of a DCI format 2_8 with CRC scrambled by an NCR-RNTI. A time resource and a corresponding beam index for transmissions or receptions on the access link are indicated by corresponding fields in DCI format 2_8 [4, TS 38.212]. When the NCR detects more than one DCI formats 2_8 that indicate beam indexes for time resources overlapping in a set of symbols, the NCR uses for the set of symbols a beam index that is indicated by a DCI format 2_8 that the NCR-MT detects in a most recent PDCCH monitoring occasion. If the NCR detects a DCI format 2_8 indicating more than one time resources that overlap in a set of symbols, the NCR expects that beam indexes associated with the more than one time resources have a same value. The time resource starts at a slot that is offset by slotOffsetAperiodic slots from a reference slot and at a symbol that is offset by symbolOffset from the start of the slot, and has a duration provided by durationInSymbols for a SCS provided by referenceSCS and the cyclicPrefix of the active DL BWP. The reference slot is the first slot with the SCS provided by\u00a0referenceSCS\u00a0that starts no earlier than the start of a slot that is after a slot of a PDCCH reception that provides the DCI format 2_8 by a number of slots indicated by ncr-AperiodicBeamInd-AccessLink [18, TS 38.306] with the SCS of PDCCH reception. \nIf \n-\ta first time resource provided by NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResourceSet is indicated by the NCR Access Link Beam Indication MAC CE command and is associated with a first beam index, and \n-\ta second time resource is provided by NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet and is associated with a second beam index, and \n-\tthe first time resource overlaps with the second time resource in a set of symbols,\nthe NCR applies, for transmissions or receptions on the access link in the set of symbols, the second beam index if only NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet includes priorityFlag, and the first beam index otherwise. \nIf \n-\ta first time resource is provided by NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet, or provided by NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResourceSet and indicated by the NCR Access Link Beam Indication MAC CE command, and is associated with a first beam index, and \n-\ta second time resource is indicated by DCI format 2_8 and is associated with a second beam index provided by the DCI format 2_8, and\n-\tthe first time resource overlaps with the second time resource in a set of symbols,\nthe NCR applies, for transmissions or receptions on the access link in the set of symbols, \n-\tthe first beam index if NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet or NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResourceSet includes priorityFlag, and\n-\tthe second beam index if NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet or NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResourceSet does not include priorityFlag.\nThe NCR does not expect overlapping time resources provided by either NCR-PeriodicFwdResourceSet or NCR-SemiPersistentFwdResourceSet to be associated with different beam indexes.\n21\tL1/L2-triggered mobility procedures\nA UE can be indicated, by LTM-Config, candidate cells and SS/PBCH blocks per candidate cell for the UE to obtain synchronization and measure corresponding L1-RSRPs [10, TS 38.133]. A Candidate Cell TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE can activate TCI states, provided by CandidateTCI-State or/and CandidateTCI-UL-State, associated with SS/PBCH blocks or TRS of corresponding candidate cells [11, TS 38.321]. If the Candidate Cell TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE activates TCI states, an LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE can indicate a TCI state from the activated TCI states; otherwise, the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE can activate and indicate a TCI state, provided by CandidateTCI-State or/and CandidateTCI-UL-State. After reception of the LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE, activated TCI states that are not indicated by the MAC CE are deactivated. The UE is provided configurations by LTM-CSI-ReportConfigToAddModList for reporting L1-RSRP measurements [6, TS 38.214] that include a number of candidate cells and a number of SS/PBCH blocks per candidate cell from the number of candidate cells. \nIf ltm-UE-MeasuredTA-ID of a candidate cell and ltm-UE-MeasuredTA-ID of the serving cell are provided to a UE and have same value, the UE estimates based on the UE implementation a timing advance to apply from a first transmission on the candidate cell that is after the reception of a cell switch command for the candidate cell [11, TS 38.321].\nA UE can be provided configurations, by EarlyUlSyncConfig, for PRACH transmission parameters for each of the candidate cells. The UE can be triggered a PRACH transmission on a candidate cell by a PDCCH order that the UE receives on a serving cell and includes an indication of the candidate cell for the PRACH transmission [4, TS 38.212]. If the serving cell and the candidate cell operate in a same frequency range and the UE would have transmissions that overlap in time, or when a gap between a first or last symbol of a PRACH transmission to the candidate cell is less than \ud835\udc41 symbols from a last or first symbol, respectively, of an UL transmission to the serving cell, where  is defined in Clause 8.1, the UE \n-\tdrops the transmissions on the serving cell when the UE does not support transmissions that overlap in time or are separated by less than the gap on the serving cell and the candidate cell\n-\tprioritizes power allocation to the PRACH transmission on the candidate cell in clause 7.5 when the UE supports transmissions that overlap in time or are separated by less than the gap, and a total UE transmit power in the frequency range would exceed \nThe UE transmits the PRACH on the candidate cell as described in Clause 8.1 with a power determined as described in Clause 7.4. \nA UE can be provided by a LTM Cell Switch Command MAC CE in a PDSCH reception on the serving cell [11, TS 38.321] a CandidateTCI-State and/or CandidateTCI-UL-State in ltm-DL-OrJointTCI-StateToAddModList and/or ltm-UL-TCI-ToAddModList indicating a unified TCI state [6, TS 38.214] for applicable receptions or transmissions on a candidate cell from the number of candidate cells. The UE may assume that DM-RS antenna ports for PDCCH receptions and for PDSCH receptions are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the TRS in the TCI state with respect to quasi co-location 'typeA' and 'typeD' properties, when applicable. The UE does not expect to be indicated quasi co-location 'typeA' properties when a SS/PBCH block is configured as a source RS of the TCI state. The UE applies the CandidateTCI-State and/or CandidateTCI-UL-State, if indicated by the MAC CE, no later than  after the last symbol of a PUCCH or PUSCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH providing the MAC CE, where , ,  and  are defined in [10, TS 38.133]. For RACH-based LTM cell switch [19, TS 38.300], the UE applies the CandidateTCI-State for receptions on the candidate cell, and applies a spatial domain filter corresponding to the CandidateTCI-State or the CandidateTCI-UL-State for transmissions on the candidate cell, that are after the completion of the random access procedure associated with the PRACH transmission on the candidate cell and before a new TCI state is indicated for the candidate cell. For RACH-less LTM cell switch [19, TS 38.300], the UE applies the CandidateTCI-State for receptions on the candidate cell and applies a spatial domain filter corresponding to the CandidateTCI-State or the CandidateTCI-UL-State for transmissions on the candidate cell before a new TCI state is indicated for the candidate cell.\n22\tPUSCH transmission in NTN RACH-less handover\n22.1\tConfigured-grant PUSCH transmission\nA UE indicated to perform PUSCH transmission in RACH-less handover can be provided one or more configurations by respective one or more ConfiguredGrantConfig, for configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmissions on the initial UL BWP [12, TS 38.331]. For the remaining of this clause, PUSCH transmissions refer to configured grant Type-1 PUSCH transmissions for a configuration provided by ConfiguredGrantConfig. \nA UE can be provided by ntn-SSB-Subset a number of SS/PBCH block indexes  to map to a number of valid PUSCH occasions for PUSCH transmissions over an association period. If the UE is not provided ntn-SSB-Subset, the UE determines  from the value of ssb-PositionsInBurst in ServingCellConfigCommon. A PUSCH occasion for a PUSCH transmission is defined by a time resource and a frequency resource and is associated with a DM-RS provided by cg-DMRS-Configuration for the configuration of PUSCH transmissions. A UE can be provided a number of repetitions for a PUSCH transmission by repK or numberOfRepetitions. If the number of repetitions is provided and larger than 1, all the PUSCH occasions of the repetitions for the PUSCH transmission are mapped to the same SS/PBCH block index(es) and the UE encodes the transport block using redundancy version number 0 if the UE is not provided repK-RV.  \nAn association period, starting from frame with SFN 0, for mapping  SS/PBCH block indexes, from the number of SS/PBCH block indexes, to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources is the smallest value in the set determined by the PUSCH configuration period provided by periodicity\u00a0in ConfiguredGrantConfig according to Table 19.1-1 such that  SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DM-RS resources within the association period. A UE is provided a number of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with a PUSCH occasion and a DM-RS resource by ntn-SSB-PerCG-PUSCH. If after an integer number of SS/PBCH block indexes to PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources mapping cycles within the association period there is a set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources that are not mapped to  SS/PBCH block indexes, no SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources. An association pattern period includes one or more association periods and is determined so that a pattern between PUSCH occasions with associated DMRS resources and SS/PBCH block indexes repeats at most every 640 msec. PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources not associated with SS/PBCH block indexes after an integer number of association periods, if any, are not used for PUSCH transmissions.\n SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to valid PUSCH occasions and associated DMRS resources in the following order\n-\tfirst, in increasing order of DMRS resource indexes within a PUSCH occasion, where a DMRS resource index  is determined first in an ascending order of a DMRS port index and second in an ascending order of a DMRS sequence index [4, TS 38.211]\n-\tsecond, in increasing order of PUSCH configuration period indexes\nA PUSCH occasion is valid if it does not overlap with a valid PRACH occasion as described in clause 8.1. \nA UE determines a power of a PUSCH transmission as described in clause 7.1.1, where the UE obtains  using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH block with index associated with the PUSCH transmission.\n22.2\tDynamic-grant PUSCH transmission\nIf dg-beam is provided in RACH-LessHO, the UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDCCH receptions for scheduling initial PUSCH transmission and the SS/PBCH block indicated by dg-beam are quasi co-located with respect to average gain and quasi co-location 'typeA' or 'typeD' properties.\n\nAnnex A:\nChange history\n\n",
